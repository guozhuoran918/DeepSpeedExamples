"In a first, US-based scientists claim to have developed a vaccine for chikungunya fever from an insect-specific virus that does not affect people. Scientists used an Eilat virus clone to design a hybrid virus-based vaccine, which is structurally identical to the natural chikungunya virus. The hybrid virus can replicate in mosquitoes, but not in mammals.","summarize: Houston, Dec 20 (PTI) Scientists have developed the first vaccine for chikungunya fever made from an insect-specific virus that does not have any effect on people, making it safe and effective. The newly developed vaccine quickly produces a strong immune defence and completely protects mice and nonhuman primates from disease when exposed to the chikungunya virus, researchers said. ""This vaccine offers efficient, safe and affordable protection against chikungunya and builds the foundation for using viruses that only infect insects to develop vaccines against other insect-borne diseases,"" said Scott Weaver, professor at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) in the US. Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne virus that causes a disease characterised by fever and severe joint pain, often in hands and feet, and may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash. Some patients will feel better within a week but many develop longer-term joint pain that can last up to years. Death is rare but can occur, researchers said. Traditionally, vaccine development involves trade-offs between how quickly the vaccine works and safety. Live-attenuated vaccines that are made from weakened versions of a live pathogen typically offer rapid and durable immunity but reduced safety. On the other hand, the inability of inactivated vaccines to replicate enhances safety at the expense of effectiveness, often requiring several doses and boosters to work properly. There may be a risk of disease with both of these vaccine types, either from incomplete inactivation of the virus or from incomplete or unstable weakening of the live virus that is only recognised when rare vulnerable individuals develop disease. To overcome these trade-offs, the researchers used the Eilat virus as a vaccine platform since it only infects insects and has no impact on people. The UTMB researchers used an Eilat virus clone to design a hybrid virus-based vaccine containing chikungunya structural proteins. The Eilat/Chikungunya vaccine was found to be structurally identical to natural chikungunya virus. The difference is that although the hybrid virus replicates very well in mosquito cells, it cannot replicate in mammals. "
"Indian Super League side Atletico de Kolkata has been renamed to 'Aamar, Tomar Kolkata' (ATK) after the team's partnership with Spanish football club Atletico Madrid ended. The Spanish club, which had provided technical support to the Indian club, will be selling their stake in the club to the club's principal owner Sanjiv Goenka. ","summarize: For Atletico de Kolkata (ATK) there is lots in a name. Or an acronym.So though Atletico Madrid won?t partner anymore, the Kolkata franchise of the Indian Super League (ISL) will continue to be known as ATK, said its principal owner Sanjiv Goenka.And would ATK continue to stand for what is was over the past three years? ?The name of the team is the name of the team and it is ATK. It can also stand for Aamar, Tomar Kolkata,? said Goenka. Translated from Bengali, that would mean the team for every Kolkatan.Speaking after the media conference where Goenka said this, a team official said it is premature to say that henceforth ATK would stand for something apart from what was coined three years ago after the La Liga giants came on board with a 25% stake in the ownership.?ATM (Atletico de Madrid) will sell their stake to me,? said Goenka. ?ATM and ATK have come to an agreement that they will not be part of ATK going forward. We?ve had a good relationship and we continue to be friends.?Goenka pointed out that the Madrid club hadn?t spent ?a penny? since joining in 2014. Atletico Madrid provided technical support including but not restricted to the coaching staff. They facilitated the pre-seasons in Madrid and were a major help in recruiting foreign players. The consistency of their imports played a major role in ATK winning two championships and being the semi-finalists in another.?We have competent technical team. Teddy (Sheringham) and Ashley (Westwood) bring a lot of experience, success and vision. And I hope we can fulfil expectation fans have from us. We have not let our fans down in the last three years,? said Goenka.?Babes compared to Bagan, EB?Goenka said even though the I-League and the ISL would be held simultaneously this season, there is no competition between ATK and Mohun Bagan and East Bengal in terms of garnering support. ?Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are great clubs with great legacies. We?ve grown up watching them, idolising them. We are not competing with anyone. They are ?dadas?, we are ?bachchas?,? he said."
"The Bombay High Court on Friday criticised the Maharashtra government for the 'pitiable' and 'ridiculous' condition of its residential schools in tribal areas.

The state was directed to provide students basic facilities such as clean drinking water, mattresses, healthcare, and toilets.","summarize: The Bombay high court on Friday criticised the Maharashtra government for its apathy towards students in its ashram (residential) schools in tribal areas. Terming the condition of such schools ?pitiable? and ?ridiculous?, a bench of justices RM Savant and Sadhana Jadhav said that the state had wasted time by constituting one committee after another but and had taken no steps to improve the infrastructure and facilities of these schools.The bench directed the secretary of the state tribal welfare department to file within three weeks a compliance report, including remedial measures, to improve the conditions of ashram schools in Maharashtra. It directed the state to provide basic facilities such as clean drinking water, mattresses, healthcare, toilets etc.These schools, meant primarily for children from tribal areas in the state, battle neglect and government apathy. The direction came while the bench was hearing a public interest litigation claiming that 793 children had died over the past 10 years in various ashram schools. The reasons for these deaths ranged from snake bites to fevers to other illnesses. ?This is really ridiculous. The state government is obligated to provide basic facilities. It is the government?s duty and responsibility. Except passing hollow resolutions, the government has done little to improve the condition,? the bench said. ?Immediate action must be taken to provide basic facilities such as clean and adequate number of toilets, drinking water facility, medical treatment, beddings and mattresses in hostels etc. The government must also appoint a female warden in each school that has girl students,? the bench said. The high court is likely to hear the matter on August 11.  "

"Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has said that India's Kulbhushan Jadhav is a bigger terrorist than Ajmal Kasab, who was executed by India for 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. Claiming that Kasab was just a 'pawn', Musharraf added, ""I don't even know how many people's deaths Jadhav is responsible for."" He further said that India did wrong to approach the ICJ. ","summarize: Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf on Friday said that Kulbhushan Jadhav is a bigger terrorist than Ajmal Kasab, one of the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which more than 150 people were killed. Jadhav, a former Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in April this year on charges of espionage. Pakistan alleges that Jadhav is a Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) agent and is responsible for fomenting unrest in Balochistan, the troubled Pakistani region where Islamabad has long accused RAW of promoting terrorism.In an interview to Pakistan's ARY News, Musharraf drew parallels between Jadhav and Kasab, who was hanged to death in India for his role in the Mumbai attacks. Musharraf said Kasab was just a ""pawn"" while Jadhav is responsible for getting ""dozens of people"" to carry out terrorist activities. ""Who is a bigger culprit (between Jadhav and Kasab),"" Musharraf rhetorically asked, before saying, ""Obviously it is Jadhav."" ""I don't even know how many people's deaths Jadhav is responsible for,"" Musharraf added.The former Pakistani army chief also slammed his country for appearing in the International Court of Justice, which this week put a stay on Jadhav's death sentence. ""It was wrong that India went to the ICJ,"" Musharraf said, adding, ""Pakistan should not have gone (to the ICJ"". Issues of espionage and sabotage are Pakistan's internal matters, Musharraf added, saying no one has the authority to advise his country on these issues. He also went on to indicate that world bodies like the United Nations and the International Court of Justice don't have any real power. Directives issued by these world bodies are ignored by some countries, Musharraf said when asked whether Pakistan could have realistically avoided sending a team to the ICJ to defend against India's claim. Musharraf went on to cite the example of the United States executing two German nationals in 1999 despite an ICJ provisional ruling putting a stay on the death penalty awarded to the two. THE KULBHUSHAN JADHAV ISSUE In April this year, Pakistan Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa confirmed the death sentence handed to Kulbhushan Jadhav, accused of spying.India, which slammed Jadhav's trial as 'farcical', said that Jadhav is not a spy and that he is a former Indian Navy officer-turned businessman who was kidnapped in Iran and taken to Pakistan. Contending that Islamabad had violated the Vienna Convention by not providing New Delhi consular access to Jadhav, India filed a petition at The Hague, Netherlands-based ICJ. This week, the World Court, allowing India's plea, asked Pakistan not to execute Jadhav until the ICJ has had the time to hear the matter in full and arrive at a final verdict.ALSO READ: How Pakistani media reported ICJ stay on Kulbhushan Jadhav's death sentence"

Senior citizens, women, workers and differently abled students can avail education through this programme, which will help increase literacy and reduce drop-out rates.n","summarize: Differently abled students, senior citizens and those pursuing folk arts and sports will be able to appear for class 5, 8, 10 and 12 equivalent exams even if they don?t go to a regular school. To arrest the number of drop-outs and increase literacy, the state?s school education department on Friday passed a resolution to start the Maharashtra Institute of Open Schooling (MIOS), which will have an easier syllabus, flexible exams, and skill-based subjects for those who cannot attend regular school. The institute will work on the lines of National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), which has 3,000 centres run by the Centre across India.  ?NIOS curriculum is national and does not cater to the needs of Maharashtra?s students,? said Suvarna Kharat, deputy secretary of education. MIOS will be part of the state board, that conducts class 5, 8, 10 and 12 equivalent exams, held in March-April and October-November with the regular board exams. It will follow a separate assessment style. One of its major features is that students do not have to appear for the minimum five subjects required to pass the exam at once. They can spread it over nine exams in five years, which means they can study for one or two subjects at a time. This is good for academically slow learners. Another advantage is that language subjects will carry 50 marks for written and 50 for practical exams. An 80-20 pattern will be followed in science. SSC board has discontinued this in Class 9 this year. As a special provision, students who want to pursue a career in sports and folk arts will be allowed to take the class 10 and 12 exam if they have formal schooling till class 9 or 10. ?These students don?t get time to attend regular schools, so they will benefit from the flexibility of the open schooling system,? said Kharat. The department has found that nearly five lakh students drop out of school between classes 1 and 10 in the state. Government schemes, including the provision to write Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exams as private candidates directly after class 9, have not been successful. ?One of the major reasons why the pass rate of private students is poor is that they have to study the same thing and write exams in the same pattern,? said Nand Kumar, principal secretary of the department, who issued the resolution.

"Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was awarded the death sentence by Pakistan on Monday, has been recognised by the Indian government as a former naval officer. Jadhav joined the Indian National Defence Academy in 1987 and the Indian Navy in 1991. Jadhav reportedly became a businessman after taking retirement from the Navy and travelled across the world.","summarize: Addressing Kulbhushan Jadhav as an Indian RAW agent, Pakistan's Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) released a statement saying Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav, who was living as Hussein Mubarak Patel, was arrested on March 3 last year through a ""Counter Intelligence Operation"" from Balochistan's Mashkel. The arrest was for his alleged involvement in espionage and sabotage activities against Pakistan.The statement also said that Kulbhushan Jadhav ""the spy"" has been tried through Field General Court Martial (FCGM) and was sentenced to death today.WHO IS KULBHUSHAN JADHAV? Kulbhushan Jadhav is an Indian citizen, recognised by the Indian government as a former naval officer, and was arrested by Pakistan alleging espionage. Pakistan claims Kulbhushan Jadhav, sometimes spelled Kulbhushan Yadav, was arrested near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border of Chaman in Balochistan over illegal entry into the country. India, however, claims that Kulbhushan Jadhav was abducted by Pakistan from Iran. Kulbhushan Jadhav was arrested by the Pakistani forces on March 3, 2016, and was accused of being an undercover agent of India's primary intelligence agency -- the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) -- and of being involved in propagating sectarian violence in Balochistan. Balochistan Home Minister Sarfraz Bugti accused Kulbhushan Jadhav of helping terrorists financially and alleged his involvement in Karachi unrest.  Jadhav is said to have been arrested after he was caught speaking in Marathi to his family over a mobile phone. KULBHUSHAN JADHAV'S BACKGROUND Kulbhushan Jadhav joined the Indian National Defence Academy in the year 1987. He joined the Indian Navy in the year 1991. In a video ""evidence"" Pakistan produced to prove that Kulbhushan confessed he is indeed a RAW agent, he could be heard saying he served in the Indian Navy till the 2001 Parliament attack happened.After the Parliament attack of 2001, Kulbhushan Jadhav went undercover as Hussain Mubarak Patel to gather information and intelligence within India. Jadhav, who took permanent retirement from the Indian Navy, became a businessman and travelled across the world. Kulbhushan's family members told The Indian Express last year that he carried necessary documents whenever he travelled and that they suspect he was ""framed as part of a larger political conspiracy"". Kulbhushan Jadhav, a resident of Mumbai's Hiranandani Gardens, belongs to a family of police officers. Kulbhushan's father Sudhir Jadhav retired as an Assistant Commissioner of Police in Mumbai around nine years ago and his uncle Subhash Jadhav was in charge of Bandra police station in 2002, said The Indian Express report.   A report in the DNA said that Kulbhushan set up a business of operating ferries from the Iranian port town of Bandar Abbas. Jadhav is married and has two children.KULBHUSHAN JADHAV'S CONFESSION Pakistan produced a ""video confession"" in which Kulbhushan Jadhav could be seen narrating that he was a serving Indian Naval officer and that he was undercover in Pakistan as part of his work with RAW. He could also be seen accepting that he launched an operation to destabilise Pakistan from the Iranian port of Chabahar and that RAW had been funding the sectarians in Balochistan.Here is the video Pakistan produced: DOCTORED VIDEO India Today had accessed intelligence reports that indicate that the video of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the so-called Indian spy, is a doctored one. Also, intelligence agencies suspect that a group named Jaishul Adil that owes its allegiance to the Al-Qaeda is responsible for kidnapping the Indian businessman.|| Also read : 'Spy' Kulbhushan Yadav not caught but abducted by extremist Sunni group Jaishul Adil"" ||INDIAN GOVERNMENT'S STANCE"

"The Maharashtra government has allotted 250 hectares of forest land in Raigad district to the City and Industrial Development Corporation for the development of Navi Mumbai International Airport. The state officials said that the project is site-specific, with no alternative non-forest land available for it. The corporation has reportedly assured to plant thrice the number of trees destroyed.","summarize:  Having secured a Union government clearance to handover forest land for the proposed Navi Mumbai airport after much delay, the state government has formally set aside 250 hectares of forest land in Raigad district to the City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) for the project.A delay in getting the forest land had held up crucial pre-development works for the Rs16,000-crore Navi Mumbai airport project. The state revenue and forests department issued a government resolution on Tuesday paving the way for the transfer of the said land, spread over 12 villages in the Panvel tehsil. An official from the state forests department said, ?The Union Ministry of Environment and Forests gave a clearance to transfer 250 hectare of forest land for the project with a few conditions in April this year. The government has already vetted the project in detail and it is established that it is a site-specific project and there is no alternative non-forest land available for it, so we have processed the transfer of land provided CIDCO adheres to the conditions put down by the Union government.?The airport is proposed to be built on 1,160 hectares of land, of which 250 hectares is forest land, including mangroves. Cidco has offered a green patch of 242 hectares in exchange near Khopoli and has assured to plant three times the amount of mangroves destroyed.Prajakta L. Verma, joint managing director at Cidco, said, ?In the absence of a clearance for the forest land, we had started basic surveys and soil investigations as part of the pre-development work. We started works such as rock cutting and blasting after getting a forest clearance. The state government?s resolution now paves the way for the official handover of the land and transfer of the title to enable us to work more smoothly.?The pre-development work involves flattening a hillock, reclaiming marsh land and diverting a river to make way for the construction of the airport, and is expected to take a year-and-a-half to complete. Cidco hopes to wind it up by mid-2018. With the forest land in possession, the only major challenge for the completion of the pre-development work is the rehabilitation of about 3,000 families. ?Most of the project-affected people have agreed to shift, while some have even started shifting out. A majority of the families are likely to shift once the rainy season is over,? Verma said.The state government first proposed the Navi Mumbai International airport 20 years ago, and accorded the plan an approval in 2007. The greenfield airport project has, however, faced several hiccups owing to resistance to land acquisition and delays in getting government clearances. Cidco now hopes to complete the project by 2020. The GVK-led Mumbai International Airport Ltd has won the bid to develop the new airport."

"Krishna Chinthapalli, an Indian-origin doctor in London, had warned against the type of ransomware attack which hit 99 countries on Friday. He had published an article just two days before the attack about the vulnerability of Britain's National Health Service to ransomware. ""We should be prepared: more hospitals will almost certainly be shut down by ransomware this year,"" he wrote.","summarize: (Eds: Updating with additional inputs) From Aditi Khanna London, May 13 (PTI) An Indian-origin doctor based in London had warned against the cyber-hack of the UKs state-run National Health Service just days before it crippled the countrys network. Krishna Chinthapalli, a neurology registrar at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, had said an increasing number of hospitals could be shut down by ransomeware attacks in an article on the vulnerability of the NHS network in the British Medical Journal on Wednesday, two days before the major cyber hack of the National Health Service (NHS) system on Friday. He had highlighted an incident at Papworth Hospital near Cambridge where a nurse clicked on a malicious link and malware infected her computer and started to encrypt sensitive files. ""Fortunately, the hospitals daily data backup had just been completed. The IT director admitted that they were very lucky, saying, Timing absolutely was everything for us,"" Chinthapalli wrote. ""We should be prepared: more hospitals will almost certainly be shut down by ransomware this year,"" he wrote. The revelation came as UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd confirmed today that as many as 48 NHS trusts had been affected by the large-scale cyber-hack by an international criminal gang wreaked havoc around the country. After chairing an emergency meeting of the COBRA committee, Rudd said that all but 6 trusts were now back to normal. Confirming that 97 per cent of hospitals were ""back to normal"", she said, ""This is a virus that attacked Windows platforms. The fact is the NHS has fallen victim to this."" The Opposition Liberal Democrat and Labour parties have both demanded an inquiry into the cyber-attack. Patients of the state-funded country-wide service are still facing days of chaos as appointments and surgeries were cancelled after NHS organisations from London to Scotland were hit in the ""ransomware"" attack yesterday. NHS Digital said the impact of the cyberattack could continue. ""The situation is changing and impacting organisations in a range of different ways,"" a spokesperson said. Ciaran Martin, who leads the UKs National Cyber Security Centre, said his team was doing everything in their power to get ""vital services"" back up and running. ""We are very aware that attacks on critical services such as the NHS have a massive impact on individuals and their families, and we are doing everything in our power to help them restore these vital services,"" he said. ""Its important to understand that cyber attacks can be different from other forms of crime in that their sometimes highly technical and anonymous nature means it can take some time to understand how it worked, who was behind it and what the impact is,"" he told the BBC. Critically ill patients are being diverted to unaffected hospitals as computer systems failed in A&E units and doctors were locked out of test results, X-rays and patient records. NHS England said patients needing emergency treatment should go to Accidents & Emergency (A&E) or access emergency services as they normally would. However, there have been some reports of ambulances being diverted from affected hospitals and individual NHS trusts have asked registered patients not to attend unless it is urgent. Londons Barts Health NHS Trust, the largest trust in the UK, cancelled all outpatient appointments at its five hospitals today. The NHS has not been affected in Wales and Northern Ireland. The assault is part of an attack that has affected organisations in more than 70 countries, including the United States, China, Russia and Spain, disrupting power and telephone companies. Gangs are thought to have used tools stolen from US spies and dumped online by hackers linked to Russia. ""This is not targeted at the NHS, its an international attack and a number of countries and organisations have been affected,"" British Prime Minister Theresa May said. ""The National Cyber Security Centre is working closely with NHS Digital to ensure they support the organisations concerned and that they protect patient safety. We are not aware of any evidence that patient data has been compromised,"" she said. The attack came after warnings of NHS vulnerability, with cybersecurity allegedly neglected despite a series of attempted hacks. Ransomware programmes, which are sent by email and spread swiftly, can be bought on the dark web with sellers negotiating a percentage of the takings. ""We will be advising NHS trusts to modernise their platforms,"" UK home secretary Amber Rudd said. The malware used in the NHS attack is called WannaCry and attacks Windows operating systems. It encrypts files on a users computer, blocking them from view, before demanding money, via an on-screen message, to access them again. The demand is for a payment of 300 dollars in virtual currency Bitcoin to unlock the files. "

Their support in polls is a tacit approval of the BJP's stand on the issue,"" said MRM national coordinator Mohammad Afzal.""The fact that the BJP did not field a single Muslim candidate for the UP polls did not deter women of the community to at least in part vote for the party,"" claimed another functionary of the MRM on conditions of anonymity.Afzal also said the traditional clergy of the community needed to wake up. ""The fact that a terrorist was killed and his father denounced him in the light of the latter's love for the nation and then a girl is issued a fatwa against for singingâ?¦all these things point to the changing scenario in India.

The only way track and field has left to go is up.?Bolt has raced only three times this season, and last month appeared to be struggling with a back injury, but he insisted he was still the man to beat in the 100m, the qualifying rounds for which start on Friday. ?For some reason I am the underdog,? he said. ?That is what my team keep telling me so I have to prove myself once more. But I am confident in my abilities, always. When I go out there I am fully confident and ready to go ? 100%.?The last 100m race I ran was a 9.95sec which shows I am going in the right direction.

For me that will be the biggest headline. Unbeatable and unstoppable.?The Jamaican also insisted that he had been provided with extra motivation to win yet another world title following the tragic death of his close friend Germaine Mason, the Olympic silver medal winning high jumper, in a road accident in April.?It was a rough time,? he said. ?I have never had someone who passed away so close to me. I didn?t train for three weeks. My coach gave me my space, he gave me my time to get over it. But at some point the close net of people I was with said: ?Listen to us, Usain, I know it is hard but you need to get back training because Germaine would have wanted it ? he was looking forward to coming to your last race and seeing you compete and finishing off your legacy.??That really helped me get going again. It was hard. But now I really want to do it for him and his family ? and all the friends that supported me in the hard times.?"

She also said that the male perspective which dominates popular culture, has led to discrimination against women and ""makes stalking seem like love, makes harassment...abuse of women okay"".","summarize: A Bollywood director whose ?lady oriented? film was blocked by censors has hit back at the movie establishment, saying it needs more women at the top to battle deep-rooted Indian prejudice. ?The censors have a problem with a female point of view; they?re just not comfortable with something that questions or disturbs the status quo,? said Alankrita Shrivastava, whose film has now overcome its critics and will be released in Indian cinemas on Friday.Shrivastava said popular culture was shaped by man?s perspective, and it was therefore important to encourage more women directors, artists and storytellers. Her movie - which profiles women who break free from tradition - stars a Muslim woman and a middle-aged widow among its unlikely heroines.Shrivastava battled hard on social media for its release after India?s censor board refused to certify Lipstick Under My Burkha, calling the film ?lady oriented?.Shrivastava appealed the decision with the film certification tribunal, which said the film could be released with an adult certification and after minor cuts. Relating the story of four women who want to realise their dreams, the movie has sparked a debate in India over what is permissible in movies and how women are actually portrayed. ?Our popular culture, our cinema is largely a product of the male gaze, for the male gaze,? she said.?Art and popular culture are powerful tools we can use to have a conversation about perspective and conditioning. It can force us to think differently, see a different point of view.?Women film directors in India?s Bollywood, just as in Hollywood, make up only a small fraction of the industry. Churning out about 1,000 films a year, Bollywood is largely known for its formulaic fare of action flicks and syrupy romances with elaborate song-and-dance sequences.Movies with female protagonists and stories that challenge gender stereotypes are still rare. This has a far-reaching effect on audiences, said Shrivastava. ?Women are 50 percent of the population; we have a particular way of seeing things, but it is the male perspective that has dominated for so long in popular culture,? she said.?This perspective has led to discrimination against women, violence against women. Our popular culture justifies this perspective, and makes stalking seem like love, makes harassment and abuse of women okay.?Campaigners in India have urged the film industry to stop glorifying stalking and harassment after several violent deaths of women. There has also been a campaign to rewrite Bollywood songs to end gender stereotyping and misogyny in films."

"The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) is planning to hire monkey catchers on a contract basis for a monthly salary of ?18,000, a senior SDMC official has said. Currently, the civic agency has only one staff for the job and due to manpower shortage, only 15 monkeys were caught in last year, an official added. ","summarize: Struggling to find people willing to work as monkey catchers, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to hire them on contract. At present, the civic agency has only one staff for catching and relocating hundreds of monkeys roaming in 104 wards. Due to manpower shortage, it could catch only 15 monkeys in the last one year, said an SDMC official. Now, the corporation proposes to pay them a regular salary, even if they don?t catch any monkey. So far, SDMC pays Rs1,200 for catching and relocation of one monkey.?We are waiting for the financial approval and possibly by next week we will start the tendering process for hiring monkey catchers at a monthly salary of ?18,000. That?s the last thing we can do to attract monkey catchers,? said a senior SDMC official. For the past three years, the corporation has written letters to the state governments asking for help in procuring services of monkey catchers. ?We wrote to different states corporations such as Haryana, UP, HP and Andhra Pradesh for providing monkey catchers but failed to get any reply,? said RBS Tyagi, director veterinary department, SDMC.According to him, there are multiple reasons responsible for existing shortage of workforce.?The monkeys are protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. They are looked after by the wildlife department after they?re relocated at the Asola Bhatti Mines Sanctuary. So ideally it should be the department?s responsibility to catch the monkeys,? said Tyagi.The SDMC claimed it shared the facts with the wildlife department and but didn?t get any reply. ?Except for Rajasthan, no other state corporations are catching monkeys,? said a senior SDMC official. SDMC will soon file an affidavit in the Delhi high court, asking that the responsibility of catching and relocating monkeys be shifted to the Delhi government?s wildlife department.Officials said that the monkeys that are relocated to the forest of Asola Bhatti mines are coming back to the residential areas in search of food. ?We have received complaints from neighbouring schools, dispensaries and residential areas about simians coming in groups to steal food from people?s houses and attack them. But we are helpless,? said a senior official. Besides, the animal lovers also add to the problem by filing police complaints against corporations and monkey catchers when the simians are caught in ones and twos, not troops.?Such an incident happened in Nizamuddin and our staff was harassed unnecessarily. In fact, it is a major reason why monkey catchers don?t want to work in Delhi,? said an official."

The company said that this makes Jio one of the fastest growing services ever and claimed that in the initial days it added nearly 6 lakh consumers daily.But even as Reliance touted what it has achieved with Jio, it also acknowledged that some problem with the network continued to persist. In particular it talked about the failure rate for the call connectivity between a Jio number and a number provided by other telecom operators. And for the high failure rate, it squarely blamed Airtel.""Jio continues to face interconnection congestion issues with some of the large operators on account of inadequate provision of points of interconnection (POI) capacities even months after commencement of services by Jio... The resultant call failure rates continue to be of the order of 175 calls failing out of every 1,000 calls from Jio to Airtel network when the QoS regulations mandate that no more than 5 calls out of every 1,000 calls can fail.

But in December this offer ended and all the consumers were moved to the Happy New Year Offer, which also gave consumers same free calls and data connectivity.

"The world's eight richest people together own assets worth $426 billion, equivalent to the wealth owned by world's poorest 50%, according to a report by charitable organisation Oxfam. Microsoft's Bill Gates is the world's richest person followed by Zara's Amancio Ortega and Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett. The report attributed wealth inequality to aggressive wage restraint and tax dodging.","summarize: The world?s eight richest billionaires control the same wealth between them as the poorest half of the globe?s population, according to a charity warning of an ever-increasing and dangerous concentration of wealth.In a report published to coincide with the start of the week-long World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Oxfam said it was ?beyond grotesque? that a handful of rich men headed by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates are worth $426bn (£350bn), equivalent to the wealth of 3.6 billion people.The development charity called for a new economic model to reverse an inequality trend that it said helped to explain Brexit and Donald Trump?s victory in the US presidential election.Oxfam blamed rising inequality on aggressive wage restraint, tax dodging and the squeezing of producers by companies, adding that businesses were too focused on delivering ever-higher returns to wealthy owners and top executives.The World Economic Forum (WEF) said last week that rising inequality and social polarisation posed two of the biggest risks to the global economy in 2017 and could result in the rolling back of globalisation.Oxfam said the world?s poorest 50% owned the same in assets as the $426bn owned by a group headed by Gates, Amancio Ortega, the founder of the Spanish fashion chain Zara, and Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway.The others are Carlos Slim Helú: the Mexican telecoms tycoon and owner of conglomerate Grupo Carso; Jeff Bezos: the founder of Amazon; Mark Zuckerberg: the founder of Facebook; Larry Ellison, chief executive of US tech firm Oracle; and Michael Bloomberg; a former mayor of New York and founder and owner of the Bloomberg news and financial information service.Last year, Oxfam said the world?s 62 richest billionaires were as wealthy as half the world?s population. However, the number has dropped to eight in 2017 because new information shows that poverty in China and India is worse than previously thought, making the bottom 50% even worse off and widening the gap between rich and poor.With members of the forum due to arrive on Monday in Switzerland, where guests will range from the Chinese president Xi Jinping, to pop star Shakira, the WEF released its own inclusive growth and development report in which it said median income had fallen by an average of 2.4% between 2008 and 2013 across 26 advanced nations.Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Iceland and Denmark filled the top five places in the WEF?s inclusive development index, with Britain 21st and the US 23rd. The body that organises the Davos event said rising inequality was not an ?iron law of capitalism?, but a matter of making the right policy choices.The WEF report found that 51% of the 103 countries for which data was available saw their inclusive development index scores decline over the past five years, ?attesting to the legitimacy of public concern and the challenge facing policymakers regarding the difficulty of translating economic growth into broad social progress?.Basing its research on the Forbes rich list and data provided by investment bank Credit Suisse, Oxfam said the vast majority of people in the bottom half of the world?s population were facing a daily struggle to survive, with 70% of them living in low-income countries. It was four years since the WEF had first identified inequality as a threat to social stability, but that the gap between rich and poor has continued to widen, Oxfam added.?From Brexit to the success of Donald Trump?s presidential campaign, a worrying rise in racism and the widespread disillusionment with mainstream politics, there are increasing signs that more and more people in rich countries are no longer willing to tolerate the status quo,? the report said.The charity said new information had shown that poor people in China and India owned even fewer assets than previously thought, making the wealth gap more pronounced than it thought a year ago, when it announced that 62 billionaires owned the same wealth as the poorest half of the global population.Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB, said: ?This year?s snapshot of inequality is clearer, more accurate and more shocking than ever before. It is beyond grotesque that a group of men who could easily fit in a single golf buggy own more than the poorest half of humanity. ?While one in nine people on the planet will go to bed hungry tonight, a small handful of billionaires have so much wealth they would need several lifetimes to spend it. The fact that a super-rich elite are able to prosper at the expense of the rest of us at home and overseas shows how warped our economy has become.?Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, said: ?Once again Oxfam have come out with a report that demonises capitalism, conveniently skimming over the fact that free markets have helped over 100 million people rise out of poverty in the last year alone.?The Oxfam report added that since 2015 the richest 1% has owned more wealth than the rest of the planet. It said that over the next 20 years, 500 people will hand over $2.1tn to their heirs ? a sum larger than the annual GDP of India, a country with 1.3 billion people. Between 1988 and 2011 the incomes of the poorest 10% increased by just $65, while the incomes of the richest 1% grew by $11,800 ? 182 times as much.Oxfam called for fundamental change to ensure that economies worked for everyone, not just ?a privileged few?.

"On-demand video streaming service Netflix has registered over 10 crore (100 million) subscribers worldwide with over 40 lakh subscriptions received outside the US in the past three months. ""Our streaming membership grew more than expected, from 99 million to 104 million, due to our amazing content,"" said Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. Netflix is currently available in over 190 countries.","summarize: The remarkable change in the way the world watches TV has been underlined by new data from Netflix showing that more than 100 million people worldwide now subscribe to the streaming service.The company - which is now valued at $78bn (£60bn), making it worth almost nine times as much as the UK?s ITV and1.5 times bigger then Rupert Murdoch?s 21st Century Fox - added 5.2 milllion subscribers in the second quarter.It was a far bigger number than Wall Street had expected and this is traditionally Netflix?s slowest time of the year: over the past five years it has averaged growth of less than 2 million in the spring months.Most of the growth ? more than 4 million of the new users ? came from international subscribers lured by Netflix?s combination of new shows such as The Crown and Stranger Things, while stalwarts House of Cards and Orange is the New Black are continuing tofind new audiences.In the past two decades the company has transformed from a California-based mail order DVD outfit to a global digital giant that has transformed the way the public watch TV.The company?s share price climbed almost 10% to $180 a share in after-hours trading in New York on Monday, after the new subscriber numbers were revealed. By lunchtime on Wall Street on Tuesday they were up to $183.For founder Reed Hastings, the continued success of the business the soaring number of subscribers is continued proof that his vision of pick-and-mix TV on demand will replace traditional scheduled TV.?Creating a TV network is now as easy as creating an app, and investment is pouring into content production around the world,? he said in a letter to shareholders on Monday. ?We are all co-pioneers of internet TV and, together, we are replacing linear TV.?Netflix?s binge-watching model, which was at first seen as commercial suicide by most traditional broadcasters, is now aped by rivals. Such has been its cultural impact that it even spawned an expression to refer to relaxing and catching a show ? ?Netflix and chill? ? although it has since morphed into aeuphemism for sex.Growth is now being fuelled by growth outside its home market. The boom in international growth followed the expansion of the service into 130 countries last year. More than 52 million of its 104 million subscribers now come from outside the US and only a handful of countries ? including North Korea, China and Syria ? do not have the service.Netflix doesn?t provide detailed statistics by country, but Ampere Analysis reckons there are 6.4 million UKsubscribers compared with about 5 million for Amazon Prime Video.Hastings described the growth as a ?good quarter? and said it was the result of ?our amazing content?. The firms popularity has pushed it into an elite club of go-go internet stocks, which have been recording breakneck growth, known as the ?Fangs?.The ?big four? tech and media giants - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google ? are valued on Wall Street at more than $1.5tn. Netflix has seen its share price rocket 64% over the past year ? it is worth almost four times as much as Sky ? but it still only ranks as the minnow of the group.Hastings said the company intends to invest even more in content, even though it is already pouring $6.6bn into making and acquiring TV shows and films this year. Currently nearly $16bn is due to be poured into production over the next five years.So far this huge investment has fuelled a Netflix hit machine. It has doubled its haul of Emmy nominations this year, securing 91 compared with 54 last year, for 27 titles including The Crown, Stranger Things and Master of None.Only HBO, on which Netflix has based its model, fared better, with 111 nominations. HBO spends about $2bn annually on content, and Amazon about $4.5bn, according to unofficial analyst estimates.Netflix famously refuses to reveal figures on how popular, or not, its shows are. Ampere Analysis has produced a report looking at the most cost-effective shows on Netflix by looking at programme budgets cross-referenced with popularity ratings on IMDB, to give a proxy for probable viewing.According to that data the most cost-effective shows for Netflix ? or the best value in terms of spend versus viewing ? were 1980s sci-fi drama Stranger Things, teen suicide drama 13 Reasons Why, Narcos, and Marvel series such as Jessica Jones, Daredevil and Luke Cage. House of Cards and Orange is the New Black also ranked highly.However, the hit machine also has misses. Recently, Netflix has culled a slew of underperforming shows to better balance viewer interest with climbing programme costs.Ampere says the least cost-effective shows are led by the $9m-per-episode Marco Polo, which was cancelled after two seasons and reportedly resulted in a $200m loss. Another was Baz Luhrmann?s The Get Down, which had a budget of up to $16m an episode, which was cancelled after one season. Other misses have included high-concept sci-fi series Sense8, Hemlock Grove and Girlboss.Hastings conceded there is furious competition between Netflix and other subscription on-demand TV services, from digital rivals such as Amazon and Hulu to traditional broadcasters such as Sky and the BBC. But he insisted his company was not killing their businesses.?It seems our growth just expands the market,? he said. ?The largely exclusive nature of each service?s content means that we are not direct substitutes for each other, but rather complements.?Market capitalisation of major media brandsApple $786bnAmazon $483bnDisney $163bnNetflix $78bn21st Century Fox $50.8bnSky $21bnSnap (Snapchat owner) $17.7bnTwitter $14.8bnITV $9bn"
"Municipal Corporation of Gurugram on Wednesday said that 19 out of 45 commercial building owners have decided to pay property tax instead of providing free parking to the public.

However, the owners allegedly said that revenues from parking profited them more.","summarize: Only 26 malls and commercial centres on Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) road, Golf Course Road and Sohna Road will offer free parking in their basements, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) announced on Wednesday.The MCG had earlier said it will waive property tax on basements if the same were used to provide free parking. Soon afterwards, 45 sites offered free parking but now some of the owners have agreed to pay the property tax instead of offering free parking service. As a result, the list has been trimmed to 26. Building owners said the revenue from parking is higher than the gains from the property tax waiver.The updated list is in the public domain on the civic body?s website ? www.mcg.gov.in. As reported earlier, MCG officials had reviewed the Central government?s notification regarding evaluation of property tax for commercial spaces and that to led to the civic body announcing the clause of tax waiver in lieu of free parking space.The 26 establishments offering free parking are Suncity Business Tower, Paras Twin Towers, MGF The Palm Springs Plaza, Global Foyer, Vipul Tech Square, MPD Tower, Augusta Point, Paras Downtown Tower, Central Plaza and Centrum Plaza ? all located on the Golf Course Road.

MCG Commissioner V Umashankar said.If the sites mentioned on the list are found levying a parking fee, the public can report complaints on the MCG?s toll-free number ? 1800-180-1817 ? or email to support@mcg.gov.in."

The Pink Line will be 58 km long - the longest of Metro routes. These driverless trains, known as UTO (Unattended Train Operations), will be phased in gradually after the start of the line. Initially, drivers will be deployed on both the Magenta and Pink Lines. The Pink Line will also get new signalling technology known as Communication Based Train Control (CBTC), the Delhi Metro Rail Corp (DMRC) said in a statement.""The CBTC technology will improve the coordination between the trains coming from different directions in terms of signalling, which will eventually increase the frequency of trains,"" a DMRC spokesperson told IANS. A CHALLENGING PROJECTA project under Phase-3 of DMRC, the Metro termed this stretch as ""one of the most challenging corridors"". Removal of slums from Punjabi Bagh and Mayapuri to acquire land and control heavy traffic were among factors that posed challenge during the construction, the DMRC said.

"US-based researchers have identified that the human appendix, which is often viewed as a vestigial organ with little-known use, may serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria. Mammals with an appendix were found to have higher concentrations of lymphoid tissue in the cecum, a pouch from which the appendix develops, suggesting that appendix serves as a secondary immune organ.","summarize: Washington, Jan 10 (PTI) The human appendix, which is thought to be of little use to the body, may actually serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria, a new study has found. The appendix, a narrow pouch that projects off the cecum in the digestive system, has a notorious reputation for its tendency to become inflamed (appendicitis), often resulting in surgical removal. Although it is widely viewed as a vestigial organ with little known function, the new study suggests that the appendix may serve an important purpose. In particular, it may serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria. Several other mammal species also have an appendix and studying how it evolved and functions in these species may shed light on this mysterious organ in humans. Researchers from the Midwestern University Arizona College of Osteopathic Medicine in the US gathered data on the presence or absence of the appendix and other gastrointestinal and environmental traits for 533 mammal species. They mapped the data onto a phylogeny (genetic tree) to track how the appendix has evolved through mammalian evolution, and to try to determine why some species have an appendix while others do not. They discovered that the appendix has evolved independently in several mammal lineages, over 30 separate times, and almost never disappears from a lineage once it has appeared. This suggests that the appendix likely serves an adaptive purpose. Looking at ecological factors, such as diet, climate, how social a species is, and where it lives, they were able to reject several previously proposed hypotheses that have attempted to link the appendix to dietary or environmental factors. Instead, they found that species with an appendix have higher average concentrations of lymphoid (immune) tissue in the cecum. This finding suggests that the appendix may play an important role as a secondary immune organ. "

The aim is to promote tourism, reduce travel time between the two points from 3.5 hours to 45 minutes and keep burden off the roads. ""Yamuna upstream... has the 'required depth' for navigation,"" said an official.","summarize: Delhi may join the elite club of cities with water taxi services by June end as the Centre?s Yamuna Water Taxi project to ferry tourists and public from Palla (Delhi-Haryana border) to Wazirabad is moving as per schedule.The service aims to promote tourism and reduce travel time between Wazirabad and Fatehpur Jat to 45 minutes. The distance between two points is nearly 20 kilomertres but due to poor public transport connectivity and heavy traffic movement  on the stretch (it connects the national capital to Haryana) , it takes 3.5 hours to cover the distance. Initially, only three of the five boarding points will open. The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has been appointed to implement the project and the process to procure vessels and develop infrastructure is already underway. The authority has moved a plea seeking environmental clearance from the National Green Tribunal (NGT).Amitabh Verma, chairman of IWAI, said as no permanent structure will be constructed, the authority hopes it will get a nod from the environment watchdog.  ?Things are very much on the track. Tenders for dredging, three passenger vessels, and jetties have been floated. Hopefully, by the end of June, we will start the ferry service in the city,? he said.The decision came after a feasibility study was done to identify a suitable stretch of the river for navigation and development of water transport facilities. After this, Delhi water minister Kapil Mishra along with the officials of IWAI, irrigation and flood control department and Delhi Jal Board (DJB), conducted a site inspection in July 2016. Experts disapproveEnvironmentalists are not amused with the idea and said the river does not have enough water round the year to survive such activities on a large scale. Manoj Misra, convenor of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, said the water available on the stretch is meant to be used for drinking purposes and this arrangement should not be disturbed. ?This will affect the biodiversity along the river. If one wants to use small-hand rowing boats for leisure, it makes sense but water taxis will be useless,? he said.Environmentalist Vikram Soni, a professor at Centre for Theoretical Physics, Jamia Millia Islamia, said the plan does not seem feasible because the river does not have enough water except for the three months during monsoon. ?This will lead to destruction of the flood plain. They should not touch it but make efforts to save it for future generations,? he said.Authorities optimisticAfter the feasibility study, it was found that the stretch is suitable for the implementation of one of the priority projects of road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari. ?Yamuna upstream, which is almost 22 kms from Wazirabad to Palla, is less polluted and has the ?required depth? for navigation. The study said that water taxi and recreation activities are the most feasible and environmentally sustainable for this stretch. The initiative will help keep burden off the roads to some extent,? added Verma.If the plan is implemented successfully, the authorities are optimistic that it will pave the way for introduction of more water recreational activities or sports in Delhi and the Centre?s ambitious Delhi-Agra steamer service through Agra Canal project. ?Water sports are quite common and popular abroad. This will not only help boost tourism but also facilitate to rejuvenate the river by sensitising the youth about the importance of the river,? he said."

"Israeli researchers have successfully tested a technology using fluorescent bacteria and lasers that offer a safer way to detect buried landmines. Researchers estimate that around 100 million landmines left from previous conflicts, scattered in 70 countries injure up to 20,000 people a year. The mines release vapours, smelling which the sprayed bacteria glow and get detected by lasers.","summarize: A team of researchers at an Israeli university has successfully tested a technology using fluorescent bacteria and lasers that could become a safer system for detecting buried landmines.An estimated 100m landmines are scattered in some 70 countries, a legacy of often long-past conflict, and the devices injure up to 20,000 people a year. Mine clearance work is typically dangerous, labour-intensive and costly.The team at Jerusalem?s Hebrew University has tested mine detection using bacteria genetically modified to give off a fluorescent signal when mines ? often made out plastic ? are close, which can then be detected with a laser.Reporting the findings in the journal Nature Biotechnology, the researchers say their approach relies on tiny amounts of vapour given off by the explosives in the mines.It was recognised that some plants reacted to those vapours, and the research used modified bacteria that essentially glow in contact with the explosive vapour. Encased in polymer beads scattered on the suspected minefield, that fluorescence is then detected by a laser system that researchers suggest could be mounted on a vehicle ? including drones.The system has been successfully tested in a field of real landmines, scanning the ground at a rate of around 18cm per second ? a speed the researchers hope to increase.Belkin?s team is not the first to develop bacteria that glow in the presence of explosive vapour ? similar findings were reported by a team at Edinburgh University in 2009 ? but it appears to be the first to have developed a potentially functioning detection system using the technology.?Our field data show that engineered biosensors may be useful in a landmine detection system,? said Prof Shimshon Belkin, who headed the experiment. However, the technology would need to be developed further still, he added.?For this to be possible, several challenges need to be overcome, such as enhancing the sensitivity and stability of the sensor bacteria, improving scanning speeds to cover large areas, and making the scanning apparatus more compact so it can be used on board a light unmanned aircraft or drone.?The university said in a statement: ?This appears to be the first demonstration of a functional standoff landmine detection system.? A byproduct of the research by Belkin and his team was announced three years ago: the use of modified bacteria to detect pollutants in water, suggesting further applications for the technology. "
"The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is planning to introduce a second underground metro in the city by extending the Wadala Metro 4 route by 8 kilometres, up to General Post Office. ""The corridor will be taken underground wherever we can't make it elevated. A detailed report is expected in September,"" MMRDA officials said. ","summarize:  The city could soon get its second underground Metro line after the Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ corridor. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority is planning to extend the Wadala?Ghatkopar?Thane?Kasarvadavali Metro 4 up to GPO at Fort in south Mumbai. MMRDA officials said the detailed project report is in the final stages and the Wadala-General Post Office extension is likely to be partially underground. The 8-km extension will pass through the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) on the eastern waterfront. Officials haven?t planned how much of the extension will be elevated and how much of it will be underground. The extension is being planned to provide connectivity up to south Mumbai via port land, which is going to be developed as a ?second Marine Drive? by MbPT.?The south Mumbai extension will be partially underground. The corridor will be taken underground wherever we can?t make it elevated. A detailed report is expected in September,? said Pravin Darade, additional metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA.Senior MbPT officials are keen on an underground corridor for the stretch that passes through its land. MbPT is currently carrying out a study on how to commercially exploit the its 550-hectare land parcel. They have envisaged to revamp the eastern waterfront into a hub of recreation and entertainment. ?MbPT has conveyed to the MMRDA that it would like an underground line, but the final decision will be taken once the report is out,? said a senior official.Officials added MbPT will share the project cost as the extension would help them get footfalls when port trust land is developed commercially. According to officials, the per km cost for the elevated corridor is estimated to be Rs300 crore and Rs750 crore for the underground portion.With the extension of the Metro 4, there would be two Metro lines operating in south Mumbai. The Metro-4 corridor would cater to the commuters from the eastern suburbs, while the Metro 3 would be an alternative to commuters living in the western suburbs.Read more: Mumbai metro gets machines to crush your plastic bottles, give you 25% discount on clothes, sunglasses"
"BJP on Monday asserted that the RSS had nothing to do with Yogi Adityanath's appointment as the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister.

He further said it was unfair to criticise the appointment without giving Adityanath a ""fair opportunity"" to govern.","summarize: The BJP today dismissed reports that the RSS had anything to do with the selection of hardliner Yogi Adityanath as the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and said it is unfair to criticise the decision without giving the Gorakhpur MP a ""fair opportunity"" to govern.""The RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) never interferes with the selection of chief ministers,"" Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said a day after Adityanath took over as the 21st Chief Minister of the state.A number of the former or serving members of the RSS, which is the ideological fountainhead of the BJP, have been appointed Chief Ministers recently. Uttarakhand's Trivendra Singh Rawat is a former RSS pracharak, so is Maharashtra's Devendra Fadnavis and Haryana's Manohar Lal Khattar.Naidu, who is the BJP's in-charge for Uttar Pradesh, also sought to allay the fears that Adityanath's image as a Hindutva poster boy will have a bearing on his work as the Chief Minister. ""It is very unfair to criticise Yogi Adityanath without giving him a fair opportunity,"" he said. ""Yogi Adityanathji will care for all the sections of the people and will prove his critics wrong. He will become one of the most successful CMs ever,"" he added.""The safety of the people is of prime importance. There will be zero tolerance towards crime,"" Adityanath's minister Shrikant Sharma said.On Sunday, shortly after he took oath, Yogi Adityanath had pledged to work for all sections without bias and said he believed in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's slogan: 'sabka saath sabka vikas'.Addressing his first press conference after taking oath, the controversial Gorakhpur MP also vowed to end the law and order problems in the sprawling and the country's most populous state.In an apparent move to allay fears that he, as a long-time Hindutva icon, might discriminate against the minorities, Adityanath promised there would be no bias for or against anyone."
"The Mumbai Police arrested four auto-rickshaw drivers for allegedly robbing several houses when they were empty. The accused are reportedly wanted in 12 other burglaries and were out on bail. ""We had checked the CCTV footage from the areas where they had committed burglaries and could figure out their faces enough to make a sketch,"" a police official said. ","summarize: The Vile Parle police recently arrested four people for allegedly carrying out several burglaries across Mumbai. The police added they have a prior criminal record and were out on bail. According to the Vile Parle police, the accused have been identified as Ayappa Shetty, 40, Dinesh Ramashankar Yadav, 26, Himanshu Dilip Somaiya, 34 and Sunil Baburao Shetty, 35.All of them are autorickshaw drivers and operated in Kandivali, Nalasopara, Malad and Virar. They were wanted in 12 other burglary cases, which were registered against them at various places in Mumbai.Senior police inspector, Laxman Chavan, of Vile Parle police station said, ?We have been on the lookout for the accused since the past four months and were working on information against them. We had checked the CCTV footage from the areas where they had committed burglaries and could figure out their faces enough to make a sketch. Their modus operandi was the same.?The burglars would keep an eye on house owners and figure out the timings when the owners wouldn?t be home. When their houses would be empty, the burglars would enter the house by breaking open the locks and flee with cash and gold ornaments. The accused used their autorickshaws to carry the booty and flee from the crime spot.A team led by police sub inspector Vikas Patil nabbed the accused from Kandivali on last Thursday after receiving a tip-off about their hide out. They were later taken to the Vile Parle police station.?There is a possibility that there are more members involved in the crime. We are investigating the case,? added Chavan.He also added that no recoveries have been made until now, but with the ongoing probe there is a high possibility of majority of the stolen items being recovered.The accused were kept in police custody till Monday and were produced before the Andheri magistrate court on Tuesday. They have been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for burglary, criminal conspiracy."
"Britain's 22-year-old Adam Peaty broke his own world record for the 50m breaststroke to set a new one at the World Aquatics Championships on Tuesday. Peaty swam the 50m in 26.10 seconds, eclipsing the 26.42 seconds he produced at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships. Notably, Peaty also won Britain a gold in the 100 metres breaststroke.","summarize: Adam Peaty surprised even himself after improving his own 50 metres breaststroke world record by almost half a second in one day at the world championships in Budapest on Tuesday.The Olympic champion won 100m breaststroke gold on Monday?s second day and vowed there would be ?something special? over one length on Tuesday. But even the 22-year-old did not expect what happened ? a 0.47sec improvement on the world record of 26.42sec he set in winning the 50m title in Kazan, Russia in 2015.Peaty clocked 26.10 in the morning heat, 0.44 ahead of his nearest rival, and improved his mark to 25.95 in the evening semi-final, 0.73sec clear of the field.?I didn?t think I was going to do that,? said Peaty, who shook his head in disbelief after seeing his time. Peaty, though, knows what matters is the title , when he will likely also be part of the British 4x100m mixed medley relay team seeking to win successive golds after victory in 2015. He added: ?I enjoyed it tonight. Obviously it?s nothing without the gold that goes along with it.?I?m going to be focusing now, staying neutral and see what we get tomorrow.? Peaty?s advantage is a huge margin over two lengths of the pool, let alone one. But he is focused on himself, having learned from experience since 2014 and winning Commonwealth, European, world and Olympic titles.?This morning I wasn?t prepared to do a world record,? Peaty added.?It was just me easing through the stroke and touching the wall. Progressing to the semi-final. It was the same tonight. I was on such a massive high from this morning and it was so hard to ignore the fact that I did a world record and try to get myself emotionally ready. I thought I was going to go slower [in the semi-final] because I was a little bit less energetic.?Peaty has the five fastest times in history over 50m breaststroke, a non-Olympic event, and admitted a sub-26sec swim had not been on his radar, with his focus on what he calls Project 56 ? swimming beneath 57sec over 100m, since Rio. He said: ?This morning everyone was like Project 25 and I was like ?go on then?. I just dived in tonight and was like ?I feel good?. I wasn?t that far behind after the start, which was a bonus for me.?Peaty surfaces sooner than his rivals, but so he is so powerful that he surges through the water.Cameron van der Burgh of South Africa, Peaty?s predecessor as world champion in 2013, clocked 26.54 in the morning heat, but finished his semi-final in 26.74 as Brazil?s Felipe Lima beat him in 26.68. Peaty is likely to be kept in reserve in the morning heats of the mixed medley relay, with Ross Murdoch an able deputy, and, assuming they qualify, Britain will be confident of success with Peaty coming in for an event which is now on the Olympic programme.Duncan Scott and James Guy earlier missed out on adding to Britain?s medal collection, which included Ben Proud?s 50m butterfly gold on Monday.. Scott and Guy had to settle for fourth and fifth place, respectively, in the 200m freestyle as the Olympic champion Sun Yang of China won his second gold, after 400m victory on Sunday. The Britons? semi-final times would have been good enough for the podium. ?It?s very disappointing. I think I got a little bit carried away at the start of the race,? Guy said.Scott, who begins his 100m freestyle campaign on Wednesday, said: ?I?m proud of that swim. I don?t think I did anything wrong, just others stepped up and performed when they needed to.?Kathleen Dawson was eighth in the 100m backstroke won by Canada?s Kylie Masse in a world record time of 58.10. And Sarah Vasey was eighth in the 100m breaststroke as the Olympic champion Lilly King of the United States won in 1:04.13."

Casper Read, a schoolboy from Worthing, West Sussex, was taking only his second flight alone, to stay with relatives in France. His mother helped him check in at the airport with his bags before he went through security to the gate. Read was given a boarding pass for seat 9A but after texting his mother to tell her he was aboard, another passenger claimed his seat. With the plane overbooked, Read was told to leave the plane. He texted his mother, Stephanie Portal, who returned to the airport and found staff to help locate her son in departures. Read?s grandparents had already embarked on the two-hour round trip to Toulouse from their home to meet him.Eventually, Portal persuaded easyJet to allocate her son a seat on the final departure of the day to Toulouse, although she said the airline?s system apparently showed all four flights on Thursday were overbooked.The final flight, scheduled to depart at 6.40pm, was delayed by almost three hours, meaning Read finally arrived in Toulouse well after midnight.Portal said: ?It?s crazy.

"Comedian Sunil Pal, in a Facebook video, has accused filmmaker Anees Bazmee and his friend Mayur Barot of not paying Sunil his fees for a stage show.

However, Anees completely denies the charges. ?About eight months back I was asked by Anees Bazmee and his friend Mayur Barot to perform at a family function (in Mumbai). They told me I will be paid a certain amount later. But I never got my payment. And while Anees Bazmi got busy with his film, Mubarakan, Barot kept on telling me that they were getting a cheque drawn out for me. After so much of drama when nothing happened, I even messaged Anees Bazmi saying that I am planning to file a police compliant. I was shocked when he replied that I can do whatever I want to and that it won?t affect him,? says Sunil, adding both of them even said that they would cast him in their films but that too never happened. Meanwhile, the comedian-actor also contacted Cine And TV Artistes Association (CINTAA) and they had asked him to come with a written complaint. But Sunil never went to the cops because he thought that filing a case would take too much time. He therefore decided to make a video with a message for Bazmee and shared it on his Facebook page. In the video he says that he is sorry that Mubarakan didn?t work, and that its God?s way of showing justice to those who wrong others.?I made the video and sent it to Anees Bazmee around noon on Monday but he didn?t reply. So I thought I must upload it on Facebook. Some people have come to my support. Now I am planning to take legal action against both of them.

Why will I do something like this for such a small amount? Sunil used to visit my Mumbai office and he was looking for work. Also I never promised to cast him in my film,? says the Welcome Back (2015) director. Voicing a similar opinion, Barot points out that the reason Sunil has dragged Bazmee?s name is because he is a well-known person. ?Sir (Anees Bazmi) has nothing to do with it. Sunil was looking for work and wanted to perform at this function. There was no discussion regarding remuneration. But then after sometime he said he wants his payment and even used foul language when I refused.

"The North Delhi Municipal Corporation is planning to enforce a penalty of ?100 per hour for unauthorised parking along roads that are 60 feet or wider, mostly near marketplaces. The penalty will be applicable from 8 AM to 8 PM on weekdays and ?50 will be added to the base fine of ?100 for each subsequent hour. ","summarize: You may have to pay a parking penalty of Rs 100 an hour for leaving your car on the road in areas under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. The charge could go up to Rs 1,000 for a full day?s illegal parking.The fines are part of a pilot project designed to prevent unauthorised roadside parking, a major cause of congestion on the city?s roads. If it succeeds, the east and south civic agencies could adopt the system too as previous drives to prevent people from parking illegally have flopped.The north municipality will enforce the penalty on roads 60 feet and wider, mostly near marketplaces.Delhi residents living along streets identified for the project will have to pay Rs 80 an hour for parking their cars by the roadside. Their vehicles will be towed away if they don?t. Even shopkeepers will be fined should they break the new law.The pilot project will be launched by this month-end in Model Town and Kamla Nagar.Read: Delhi?s new parking policy: Enforcement will be biggest task for civic agenciesThe penalty is applicable from 8am to 8pm on weekdays and Rs 50 will be added to the base fine of Rs 100 for each subsequent hour.Tailbacks, snarls and shrinking road space are growing problems for the city of 20 million, breathing the foulest air in the planet. The city has 10 million vehicles and toxic exhaust fumes contribute majorly to its air pollution.The courts, National Green Tribunal and government have put curbs and introduced initiatives to reduce the pollution, while the municipal corporations launched extensive drives to fine and tow away vehicles parked at unauthorised areas. But the deterrents haven?t worked much.?Issuing challans to every offender or towing away all vehicles from roadsides isn?t practically possible,? said Yoginder Singh Mann, the spokesperson for the north corporation.Besides, the fines are designed to be lower than what existing laws prescribe.Read: Parking on footpath in Delhi, may land you in jail, attract hefty fine under new policy?The Delhi municipal act says the penalty depends on the vehicle?s weight, rather than the size. That way the challan amount will be between Rs 10,000 and Rs 20,000 for each vehicle. Moreover, we don?t have space to keep towed-away cars,? Mann said.The north corporation doesn?t have tow trucks. It depends on private agencies and fellow corporations for such trucks during drives to prevent illegal parking.According to experts, the solution to traffic congestion is multilevel parking lots and discouraging people from using surface parking spaces by making them prohibitively expensive.The suggestion comes at a time the north corporation plans to double the rates for surface parking and by this month-end a pilot project will be conducted in Model Town.The success of this project may have city-wide implications. The three municipal corporations have 244 surface parking lots with a combined capacity to hold 50,000 vehicles. Of these, 99 are owned by the north corporation.The parking penalty project is initially restricted to Kamla Nagar and Model Town because these two areas have multilevel car parks. But people seldom use them because surface parking is ?cheaper and convenient?. Also, the unpoliced option of parking illegally on roads is always there.?We are expecting resistance from the people in the initial phase. That?s why only two areas have been selected for the time being. Based on the feedback, we might introduce changes,? said Renu Jagdev, the north corporation?s additional commissioner.Puneet Goel, the commissioner of South Delhi Municipal Corporation, called the north agency?s step a good move.?We will surely implement the scheme around multilevel car parking lots as their current use is extremely low. Also, it will reduce congestion on roads,? he said. The SDMC has six multilevel car parking lots.Mohanjeet Singh, the commissioner of East Delhi Municipal Corporation, has appreciated the move too.?We carried drives against vehicles parked illegally on Vikas Marg and challaned more than 1,100 vehicles. But this has not brought any drastic change to the situation. We will surely adopt the penalty parking scheme if it turns out to be successful in north Delhi.?Bhure Lal, chairman of the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority, said the initiative would help dissuade people from parking on the roadside, but most of them won?t want to pay the recurring Rs 50 an hour.?Unfortunately in areas such as Kamla Nagar, despite having a multilevel parking, people are congesting the roads. To ensure these facilities are utilised properly, the rates of surface parking lots should be increased manifold,? he said."

The chemicals, extracted from two plants, thunder god vine and aloe, are effective at low doses and have no adverse effect on egg or sperm, other than preventing a key step in fertilisation - the meeting of egg and sperm. They work by stopping sperms power kick, which is normally stimulated by the hormone progesterone secreted by cells surrounding the egg and makes the sperms tail whip forcefully to propel it toward and into the egg. According to researchers from the University of California (UC) Berkeley in the US, the chemicals may serve as an emergency contraceptive taken either before or after intercourse, or as a permanent contraceptive via a skin patch or vaginal ring. Human sperm take about five to six hours to mature once they enter the female reproductive system, which is enough time for the drug to enter the system and block the kick. Also, because the chemicals prevent fertilisation, they may be a more acceptable alternative in the eyes of those who object to emergency contraceptives that prevent the implantation of a potentially viable fertilised egg. These two plant compounds block fertilisation at very low concentrations - about 10 times lower than levels of levonorgestrel in emergency contraceptives, said Polina Lishko, an assistant professor at UC Berkeley. ""They could be a new generation of emergency contraceptive we nicknamed molecular condoms,"" said Lishko, who led the team that discovered the anti-fertility properties of the two chemicals. ""If one can use a plant-derived, non-toxic, non-hormonal compound in lesser concentration to prevent fertilisation in the first place, it could potentially be a better option,"" she said. Purusing books on natural contraceptives used by indigenous peoples around the world, researchers came across several non-steroid chemicals isolated from anti-fertility plants. One of these was pristimerin, from the plant Tripterygium wilfordii, also known as ""thunder god vine."" Leaves from the plant have been used as an antifertility drug in Chinese traditional medicine, though some compounds in the leaves are poisonous. It has also been used as a folk remedy for rheumatoid arthritis. The other chemical was lupeol, which is found in plants such as mango and dandelion root. While it has been tested as an anticancer agent, it was not suspected of having contraceptive properties. "

Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's name has been removed from the Oxford India Centre for Sustainable Development which was named the Indira Gandhi Centre for Sustainable Development at its launch during the tenure of UPA government.

Gandhi, an alumnus of the college, studied Modern History there in 1937.The memorandum of understanding to set up the centre was signed in May 2013 after then minister for human resources development MM Pallam Raju visited the college. The Indian grant of £3 million was matched by the University of Oxford.An ?Education Brief? of the Indian government dated December 1, 2016 suggests the name was changed during the year. College officials, however, told Hindustan Times there had been no pressure or suggestion from New Delhi to change the name.  The brief states: ?The Indira Gandhi Centre for Sustainable Development (IGCSD), established at the College with Government of India providing seed money of Rs 25 crore   (GBP 3 million) ? has begun work. ?The Centre is now called Oxford India Centre for Sustainable Development (OICSD). The Centre would be housed in a new building on Oxford University?s Redcliff Observatory Quarter adjacent to Somerville College. The Centre would be fully established in time for the centenary celebrations of Smt Gandhi?s birth on November 19, 1917.? Asked about the change of name, Alice Prochaska, principal of the college, said: ?We have committed to use our ?best endeavours? to set up an ?inspirational research facility?, ie an Indira Gandhi Centre for Sustainable Development, in a building on our site, and we are using our best endeavours to achieve the funding for a building that will indeed house the Indira Gandhi Centre. ?The prestigious building is a long-term plan and if we achieve it, will be larger than only the IG Centre but will include the IG Centre.  The overall building could be named for the donor. While these plans are evolving, we are using the overarching name of the Oxford India Centre for Sustainable Development for the current activity, which includes the Indira Gandhi Scholars and programme.? Gandhi visited the college in 1971 to receive an honorary doctorate. In 2002, Congress president Sonia Gandhi presented a portrait of the former prime minister, which hangs alongside a painting of Margaret Thatcher, another alumnus of the college.  The centre with the new name is seen as part of ?An historic Oxford-India Partnership?. The college describes it thus: ?The OICSD advances India?s sustainable development by bringing different academic disciplines and sectors together.?It adds, ?We develop future leaders by supporting exceptional Indian scholars to study at Oxford; we carry out multidisciplinary research on sustainable nutrition, the environment and health; and we translate academic ideas to the ground.?In November 2016, the college celebrated the 150th birth anniversary  of Nashik-born Cornelia Sorabji (1866-1954), the first Indian woman student at Oxford who went on to become the first Indian woman lawyer in colonial India. "

","summarize: Snooty, the world?s oldest known manatee, died on Sunday at his Florida home, a day after celebrating his 69th birthday.In a statement, South Florida Museum chief executive Brynne Anne Besio said Snooty?s death appeared to be ?a heartbreaking accident? and added that staff were ?devastated?.In a press conference from Bradenton broadcast on Facebook on Sunday afternoon, museum provost and chief operating officer Jeff Rodgers said Snooty died after becoming stuck in a maintenance hatch leading off the tank he shared with three young rescued manatees, Randall, Baca and Gale.?The hatch is big enough for a 1,300lb manatee to get in,? Rodgers said. ?It appears that he was not able to get himself back around to get himself out of the situation.?Asked if Snooty had drowned, Rodgers said the manatee had been taken for a necropsy, the results of which were not yet known. The three young manatees were not injured, he said.The necropsy will be carried out by Snooty?s veterinarian of more than 20 years and the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission.Besio said: ?We?re all devastated about his passing. We?re reviewing what happened and will be conducting a full investigation. Snooty was such a unique animal and he had so much personality that people couldn?t help but be drawn to him. As you can imagine, I ? and our staff, volunteers and board members ? considered him a star.

Numbers of wild manatees in Florida have recently increased as a result of protection programmes.Manatees generally live into their teens in the wild, with some reaching their forties or older, museum spokeswoman Jessica Schubick said. Snooty was on record as the oldest manatee in captivity, having spent 68 of his 69 years at the South Florida Museum. He was believed to be the oldest manatee in the world.Rodgers ruled out malicious or foul play in the manatee?s death, although he said the opening of the hatch remained a mystery as it was designed not to let manatees in the tank push through it. A ?Snootycam? trained on the tank was turned off at night, he said, and other security cameras could not see underwater. Snooty was discovered on Sunday morning.?We?ve been greeting people at the front door to share the heartbreaking news,? Rodgers said of a day through which the aquarium remained closed. He added that staff had helped adult visitors break the news to their children ?as they saw fit?.?Aquarium staff is heartbroken,? he said. ?We are working with them as well, with the emotional situation, they?re actively caring for the three rehab manatees today so life goes on for those manatees ? We?re just making sure our manatees and our staff are well cared for.?Snooty was born in captivity in 1948 and came to the South Florida Museum the following year. Since 1979, he has been the mascot of Manatee County.

"Union Minister of Textiles Smriti Irani posted a picture of herself dressed in a cotton saree and asked people to take the #CottonIsCool trend forward. Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje shared a photo of herself wearing cotton and tweeted, ""Cotton is a statement - comfortable, fashionable. #CottonIsCool,"" while Virender Sehwag tweeted, ""#CottonIsCool, really really cool.""","summarize: When you see the likes of Vijender Singh, Amish Tripathi, Kapil Dev and Vasundhara Raje posting pictures of themselves wearing kurtas/sarees, it does spike intrigue, quite naturally. On a closer look, we discover that these sports celebrities, politicians and authors are just part of a larger virtual wave started by our Minister of Textiles, Smriti Irani. Earlier today, Smriti posted a picture of herself dressed to the T in a saree, saying she depends on cotton to stay cool in the Indian summer, thus giving birth to the trend #CottonIsCool:I celebrate Indian summers and cotton industry with my #CottonIsCool look. What is your #CottonIsCool look?! pic.twitter.com/wnLcE8jQrxShe then prompted her friends and colleagues to take the wave forward, post pictures of themselves wearing cotton, and further tag 5 more friends to not break the chain.

Why must we? Because not only does cotton keep one cool in the summer, it also gives a big boost to Indian handloom and livelihood to weavers.So, we give you four solid reasons to ditch all other fabrics in the cruel Indian summer and wear cotton everyday:1. It keeps you cool in summers and warm in winters: Basically, cotton provides thermal insulation because the fabric traps air between fibres. Cotton fibres also keep the fabric away from the skin, letting even more air pass through, which helps with insulation."

"Google's head of connectivity in India recently talked about the Google RailTel, which has started providing free WiFi at 140 railway stations in India. ""If you compare this with Wi-Fi in London and San Francisco, you will find that the Wi-Fi is better in both coverage and capacity"", he said. The initiative aims to cover 400 stations across the country.","summarize: As a part of Prime Minister Modi's Digital India initiative, the Indian Railways have partnered with Google to provide Wi-Fi broadband facility to passengers at major railway stations across the country. This Google RailTel initiative was launched in January 2016 and till date has reached 140 stations across India. Their lofty aim is to reach 400 stations by 2018.Under this initiative, RailTel, a subsidiary of the government of India provides the high speed network via Fiber while Google sets up the wireless infrastructure and provides tech support. The speeds on offer range from 20-40Mbps for 30 minutes after which they are gradually reduced in order to manage bandwidth.The India Today Tech had the opportunity to experience Google's RailTel initiative first hand at Nizamuddin Railway station. We also interviewed Gulzar Azad  -- head of connectivity, Google India -- who spoke about the partnership with RailTel, the challenges faced in bringing high-speed Wi-Fi to 140 of India's major railway stations, what Google and RailTel have learnt along the way and the road ahead for this ambitious initiative.Q: This initiative started before Jio revolutionised the telecom sector with its disruptive plans and brought 4G to the masses. Have you seen a dip in the daily usage since Jio entered the marketplace? Has the widespread and cheap availability of 4G data since the entry of Jio affected Google's RailTel strategy in any way?This is a great question. Very relevant in today's time. What we have seen is that as 4G has emerged, we have seen no dip in the Wi-Fi usage. If you talk about the time when 'free' 4G started emerging, we were at about 5 million (50 lakh) monthly active users, today we are at 6.5 million (65 lakh) monthly active users. So the RailTel initiative has only grown since then.The railway station is a great point of convergence. At this point of convergence, there is the need for multiple networks and multiple systems to satisfy the user demand. Before the advent of 'free' 4G, people were not even thinking of consuming 1GB data a month, let alone 1GB data a day.The mark of telecommunication development of any country is how close the Fiber is to the user. In effect, you must see that the Wi-Fi that we are implementing is an attempt to bring Fiber close to the user. And that is working pretty well for us.Q: During my interactions with passengers and workers at the Nizzamudin railway station, I found out that many of them feel that during peak hours the speed slows down quite a bit. Is that something you are looking into?I feel that is also a very interesting, emerging phenomenon. If you see when we started the project, even at peak hours the speed we were giving the users was very satisfactory and now people want more. This is exactly what we were expecting. Once people start experiencing high-speed internet, the user behavior changes - the expectation now is higher. There is more demand for less and less latency in the network.The good news for us is that across the last twelve months, we have not seen a dip in monthly active users. The average usage still remains 350MB per user per session which shows we have augmented the network and capacity while adding more users.As 4G has emerged, we have seen no dip in the Wi-Fi usage. If you talk about the time when 'free' 4G started emerging, we were at about 5 million monthly active users, today we are at 6.5 million monthly active usersMr Gulzar Azad then spoke about how Google is taking steps to make the RailTel initiative financially viableSince April, we have made the login process Ad supported and that is helping RailTel from an ISP perspective. The revenue is majorly meant for RailTel. We have a revenue share mechanism which is expected as we are a contributor to the project itself - Google helps build the wireless (infrastructure) and RailTel brings in the Fibre and the connectivity.Q:The RailTel initiative was in the news a couple of months ago as it was found that it was being used for watching porn in many railway stations. Were any measures put into place after that?The idea of the internet here from an experience point of view is to make it the same internet that you and I have and for that internet to be available to everyone. That is the singular goal of our vision - for a billion people to experience the internet you and I experience in our homes, in our offices.  And when we do that, we are following the regulations set by the country.The ISP (RailTel) follows the regulations from the government in terms of what's allowed on the internet and what's not. This internet is not different from every other internet across the country.Q: If we talk about the speed, I was told that 1Mbps is the minimum speed even when the 30 limit high speed cap is crossed. Is that a realistic claim?The way the network has been set up there is actually no speed limit before or after. The design of the network is such that in the first 30 minute time limit, we allow the user to get unfettered access - the idea is to get all users to a point where they could access high quality HD video streams.After the time limit is crossed, we make sure that everybody does still have internet and the net is still low latency. We are adjusting the network dynamically so that people can still access the internet but in the first half an hour they can access HD quality video streams.Q: But what is the minimum speed? - I spoke to many people and got a lot of varying replies. Some people said it is as bad as 128kbps but others said they can stream video for 24 hours.The quality of your internet is not just measured by the speed. It is also measured by the latency of the network. We have designed the network in a way that even when the network is at low speed, it is still a low latency network. The internet is dynamically configured in such a way that you will still be able perform certain use cases (like opening a search page, running apps like WhatsApp and Messenger) after the high-speed cap gets over after 30 minutes.This is a great advancement. If you compare this with Wi-Fi in London and San Francisco, you will find that the Wi-Fi is better in both coverage and capacityNote: The network is dynamically adjusted in such a way that priority is given to those who are logging in for the first time. This is why the 30 minute high-speed cap exists. During our time at the Nizamuddin railway station we got average speeds of 17-18mpbs (download) during the 30 minute unfettered limit. Also, we found out that all access points are already dual-band (2.4GHz and 5GHz capable) in order to cope with future demand.Q: What is the business model that Google and RailTel are following? How is Google benefiting from this project?For Google, this is an ecosystem project. Our idea with this is to make sure there is more and more broadband adoption. The more the adoption, the more people come online, and the greater the economic impact.When there is economic impact on digitisation, we get directly impacted because we are a stakeholder in the digitisation of the country. Also, the more people use internet, the more they use e-commerce, social networks, news websites and eventually Google services.Q: At the Nizamuddin railway station and the New Delhi railway station, which I visited a few weeks ago, the advertising is quite minimal. Also a lot of people, even in tier 1 cities like Delhi and Mumbai are unaware of this initiative. So what is Google and RailTel's future plans regarding awareness?Addressing awareness of Wi-Fi is certainly an important issue and we need the help of the Indian railways and the government to do that more and more. As you can see, the Wi-Fi is already free, so there is not much space for businesses to market on it. But the Indian Railways who host this, they should be partnering with us to make more and more awareness happen.There are various channels of awareness. We have tried audio announcements and visuals. We have also tried having agents at the station. I think to raise awareness in a sustainable way we need help from the government."
"Fungus-like organisms have been found fossilised in South African rocks dating back 2.4 billion years, pushing the oldest evidence of possible fungal life by at most 2 billion years. The fossils suggest it may have evolved underwater, scientists said. If not a fungus, the organism could be from an extinct branch of life that hasn't been described before, scientists added.","summarize: London, Apr 26 (PTI) Scientists have discovered what may be the worlds oldest fungus in South African rocks dating back 2.4 billion years. The fossils suggest that fungus may have evolved from under the deep sea rather than land. Drilled from rocks that were once beneath the seafloor, the fossils resemble living fungi and could push back the date for the oldest fungi by one to two billion years. If not a fungus, the organism could be from an extinct branch of life that has not been described before, scientists say. ""The deep biosphere where the fossils were found represents a significant portion of the Earth, but we know very little about its biology and even less about its evolutionary history,"" said Stefan Bengtson of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Sweden who led the research team. The fossils closely resemble those found in similar conditions on land. They are made up of jumbles of tangled threads some hundredths of a millimetre thick. There is a ""clear possibility"" that they are the worlds oldest fossil fungi - twice as old as generally accepted in the fossil record, Bengtson was quoted as saying by the BBC News. "
"Former PM Manmohan Singh, in a letter dated 2015, had termed the bull-taming sport Jallikattu a ""cruel form of entertainment"", while the Congress party has supported the protests against its ban in 2017. Adding that traditional Jallikattu must be allowed, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has said that it is much better than bullfighting in Spain where the Bull is killed.","summarize: The Congress party may have opposed jalikattu with its full force but today it stands a divided house. Even as party chief spokesman Randeep Surjewala walks a cautious line there are leaders like Digvijaya Singh who outrightly support it. But what puts Congress in a spot is a letter accessed exclusively by India Today written by former Prime  Minister Manmohan Singh while in opposition expressing strong disapproval for this age old Tamil tradition that has become the focus of the country's polity now.The letter is dated December 15, 2015 when the Congress was in opposition and Dr Singh seized to be the Prime Minister. This letter was written in the capacity of a Rajya Sabha MP to NG Jayasimha,the Managing Director of Humane Society International (India). Humane Society argued strongly against Jalikattu like many other organisations like People for Ethical Treatment to Animal or PETA that is at the receiving end of people's ire in Tamil Nadu today. In the said letter Dr Manmohan Singh remarked, ""The Human Society International/India affiliate has a worthy objective and certainly we have to discourage bullfights which provide a cruel form of entertainment"". Dr Singh didn't stop there but went on to ""wish you all success in achieving your objective"" of getting bull fight which is popularly known as jalikattu banned.This letter is in sync with the views expressed by many ministers in the UPA regime like Jairam Ramesh. But come today the scenario is absolutely different. A popular uprising along the Marina Beach of Chennai in demand of the sport that Tamils call an inherent part of their culture has forced many political parties to modulate their views. Congress' Chief Spokesman  Randeep Surjewala in a tweet put the onus on the centre and taking a neutral view much away from Manmohan Singh's militant opinion on jalikattu said, ""Congress respects people of Tamil Nadu in preserving the culture & tradition of Jallikattu more so as adequate safety precautions is taken. People have a legitimate right to protect their pride & conserve their culture. Govt's duty to strike a balance & respect the sentiments."" Something that was  'cruel entertainment' in 2015 turned into a 'legitimate right' in January 2017 for Congress, thanks to the popular mood.Well that is not all. Even as Surjewala tries to undo the damage, its another Spokesperson and a senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi doubles up as the counsel for the petitioners calling for a ban on the bull-taming sport of Jallikattu. According to him, Jallikattu is not a sport, it is a ""brutal and wanton"" torture of an animal and that since holding Jallikattu is not permissible under law after the Supreme Court order, even supporting or encouraging it is defiance of the Supreme Court order. So as jalikattu debate rages on, the Congress is a divided house with no single school of thought. It's general secretary supports it, it's media chief maintains a neutral view as another leader fights for the ones it's own party is not ready to openly back. And amid all these the letter bomb is surely going to put the grand old party in an even more uncomfortable spot. "

"US President Donald Trump used his speech to the 19th National Boy Scouts Jamboree in West Virginia to attack ""fake media"" for allegedly misquoting crowd size at his events. Trump also urged his audience of 12 to 18-year-olds to boo his presidential rival Hillary Clinton and predecessor Barack Obama. Trump was slammed for using the traditional address for political endorsements. ","summarize: On Monday evening, Donald Trump gave a speech to the 19th National Boy Scout Jamboree in West Virginia. Although he came armed with a prepared speech about the merits of scouting ? each US president serves as the group?s honorary president ? and declared at the start that he would not talk about politics, Trump went predictably off-script to talk about some favourite topics. And politics.Boy, you have a lot of people. The press will say it?s about 200 people. It looks like about 45,000 people.Tonight we put aside all of the policy fights in Washington DC that you have been hearing about with the fake news and all of that ? Who the hell wants to talk about politics when I?m in front of the Boy Scouts?Today I said we oughta change it from the word swamp to the word cesspool or perhaps to the word sewer, but it?s not good.The scouts believe in putting America first.The vice-president of the United States, Mike Pence ? good guy ? was a scout and it meant so much to him. Some of you here tonight might even have camped out in this yard when Mike was the governor of Indiana, but the scouting was very, very important. And by the way, where are our Indiana scouts tonight? I wonder if the television cameras will follow you; they don?t like doing that when they see these massive crowds. They don?t like doing that. Hi folks. A lot of love in this big, beautiful place. A lot of love and a lot of love for our country. There?s a lot of love for our country.By the way, what do you think the chances are that this incredible, massive crowd, record-setting, is going to be shown on television tonight? One per cent or zero? The fake media will say: President Trump ? and you know what this is ? President Trump spoke before a small crowd of Boy Scouts today. That?s some ? that is some crowd. Fake media. Fake news. Thank you.Secretary Tom Price is also here ? And hopefully he?s going to get the votes tomorrow to start our path toward killing this thing known as Obamacare that?s really hurting us, folks.By the way, are you going to get the votes? He better get them. He better get them. Oh, he better ? otherwise I?ll say, Tom, you?re fired. I?ll get somebody. He better get Senator Capito [Republican West Virginia senator Shelley Moore Capito] to vote for it. You got to get the other senators to vote for it. It?s time. After seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare, we have a chance to now do it. They better do it.By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a jamboree? And we?ll be back. We?ll be back. The answer is no, but we?ll be back.I have to tell you our economy is doing great. Our stock market has picked up since the election November 8. Do we remember that date? Was that a beautiful date? What a date. Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8, where they said ? these dishonest people ? where they said there is no path to victory for Donald Trump? ? But do you remember that incredible night with the maps and the Republicans are red and the Democrats are blue, and that map was so red, it was unbelievable and they didn?t know what to say? And you know we have a tremendous disadvantage in the electoral college ? popular vote is much easier.So I have to tell you, what we did, in all fairness, is an unbelievable tribute to you and all of the other millions and millions of people that came out and voted for Make America Great Again.And by the way, under the Trump administration, you?ll be saying Merry Christmas again when you go shopping. Believe me. Merry Christmas. They?ve been downplaying that little beautiful phrase. You?re going to be saying Merry Christmas again, folks.I?ll tell you a story that?s very interesting for me when I was young. There was a man named William Levitt, Levitttowns, you have some here, you have some in different states ? And he was a very successful man. He was a homebuilder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more successful ?And he sold his company for a tremendous amount of money. At the time especially, this was a long time ago, sold his company for a tremendous amount of money. And he went out and bought a big yacht and he had a very interesting life. I won?t go any more than that because you?re Boy Scouts, I?m not going to tell you what he did ? should I tell you? Should I tell you? Oh, you?re Boy Scouts, but you know life, you know life. So, look at you, who would think this is the Boy Scouts, right?So he had a very interesting life, and the company that bought his company was a big conglomerate. And they didn?t know anything about building homes, and they didn?t know anything about picking up the nails and the sawdust and selling it, and the scraps of wood ? So they called William Levitt up and they said, would you like to buy back your company and he said yes, I would. He so badly wanted it, he got bored with this life of yachts and sailing and all of the things he did in the south of France and other places ? But what happened is he bought back his company and he bought back a lot of empty land ? and in the end he failed and he failed badly. Lost all of his money. He went personally bankrupt, and he was now much older.And I saw him at a cocktail party and it was very sad. Because the hottest people in New York were at this party. It was the party of Steve Ross. Steve Ross, he was one of the great people. He came up and discovered ? really founded ? Time Warner, and he was a great guy. He had a lot of successful people at the party. And I was doing well so I got invited to the party.[This is a much abbreviated version: you can read the full Levitt reminiscence here and here.]"
"Unidentified dead bodies are spotted floating almost daily in the Tigris river near the recently ISIS-liberated Iraqi city of Mosul, according to reports. The bodies are the evidence of extrajudicial executions of ISIS militants by the Iraqi security forces, non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch has alleged. Soldiers have shifted the corpses to a morgue at the city's general hospital.","summarize: The bodies washed up with grim regularity on the banks of the Tigris downstream from Mosul, a daily reminder of the vicious fight against Islamic State that played out a few dozen miles away.All were heavily decomposed, most bound and blindfolded, some mutilated. The corpses began arriving last spring, but as the mission to oust Isis fighters from the once-thriving city intensified, so too did the number of dead floating towards the west bank town of Qayyarah.?I see dead bodies in the water daily,? said Ahmed Mohammed, a driver, speaking earlier this year. ?The number has increased since early April. There were five bodies floating in the river recently in one single day. They are young men with their hands tied behind their back and are blindfolded.?Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi this week declared victory after nearly nine months of fierce fighting to displace the extremist group from the city where it proclaimed its ?caliphate? in 2014. But as Mosul lies in ruins ? and the last women and children emerge from the rubble ? a bloody picture of the campaign?s impact is emerging. Local people who spotted corpses midstream would try to catch them and then call the army, Mohammed said. Soldiers then take them to a makeshift morgue at the city?s general hospital, run by Mansour Maroof Mansour. Most of the dead found in the river with some identifiable features intact were young men who appeared to be in their late 20s, said Mansour, but he has learned little else about who they were. ?We can?t identify the bodies in the river. They are very decomposed and there is nothing on them to use for identification,? he said, standing in a room filled with dozens of bodybags. None had been claimed, and even that toll of the unknown dead is not exhaustive; some bodies are lost.?(Once) the body of a boy also floated by but we could not catch it as it was too small and went through the gaps in the barrier,? said the driver Mohammed, who is haunted by guilt at letting the young boy drift away.Human rights organisations had raised alarm about the number of unsolved killings in and around Mosul city and in particular the corpses washing up along the Tigris river. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said evidence points to government forces, killing suspected Isis members or collaborators without trial or due process.Warning of the killings in April, Lama Fakih, deputy Middle East director for HRW said: ?The bodies of bound and blindfolded men are being found one after the other in and around Mosul and in the Tigris river, raising serious concerns about extrajudicial killings by government forces. The lack of any apparent government action to investigate these deaths undermines the government?s statements on protecting detainee rights.?Little has been done to investigate the killings, however. ?The horrors that the people of Mosul have witnessed and the disregard for human life by all parties to this conflict must not go unpunished,? Lynn Maalouf, research director for Amnesty International in the Middle East, said. The violence upstream casts a long shadow in Qayyarah, which was freed from Isis rule at the start of the nine-month Mosul campaign. Most residents are reluctant even to talk about the bodies in the river. ?I don?t know anything about that subject,? said one fishmonger in the newly re-opened market, buzzing with soldiers and militia fighters.Isis exploited Iraq?s sectarian tensions to facilitate its rise to power. Many Sunnis who felt disenfranchised by the Shia majority government or feared becoming targets of security forces welcomed or at least tolerated the group?s arrival in 2014. As the extremism and violence of Isis world view became clearer, many Sunnis left or privately turned against the group, but suspicions of collaboration linger and in some Sunni areas a sense of apprehension remains.?Blood for blood,? reads graffiti on a wall of a house in Qayyarah that locals say belonged to Ali Khether, a well-known Isis commander who had lived in the town. He is described by one as ?The child of adultery, Ali Khether, the Daeshi? ? a name that refers to Daesh, a pejorative name for Isis.Close by stands the town?s small stadium where Isis, with the aid of local people, killed dozens, with the most cursory of trials, on charges ranging from spying for the security services to homosexualityNow as Isis retreats to the Syrian city of Raqqa and desert areas of western Iraq, those who were on the receiving end of their brutality for over two years have set up their own militia groups. Loosely attached to the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU), they are taking the law into their own hands.?PMU militias have carried out a systematic pattern of violations, including enforced disappearance, extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings and torture of Sunni Arab men and boys, seemingly in revenge for IS attacks,? said Amnesty International in a report earlier this year.Security forces who retook the town found the bodies of many Isis victims that had been dumped in the river, said Walid Khaled an officer at Qayyarah police station, but he had no idea who the more recent waves of dead might be. ?We don?t know where they come from, they are unidentified,? he said.Some in the town say the bodies are more Isis victims killed by the last fighters holed up in Mosul, but the Iraqi security forces had blocked the river around 20km outside the city with a floating boom designed to stop fighters sneaking out or reinforcements getting in by water. Territory further down river towards Qayyarah has been in the control of Iraqi security forces for months.A soldier guarding a floating bridge connecting Munirah village, around 20km south of Mosul on the western bank, refused to give his name, but appeared to confirm that extrajudicial killings were taking place beside the river.He showed the Guardian a video of himself and other soldiers, dragging a limp body with a bloody face along the edge of the water. ?He was Daesh hiding in the reeds and we killed him,? the soldier said with satisfaction."
"Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has said that the social media platform's CEO Mark Zuckerberg is the reason she's still ""walking"" after the death of her husband in 2015. ""When I felt so overwhelmed and so isolated and just needed to cry, I would grab him into his conference room and he would just sit there with me,"" she added.n","summarize: Sheryl Sandberg has credited Mark Zuckerberg with saving her life after the sudden death of her husband, saying the Facebook co-founder and his wife, Priscilla, were ?why I?m walking?.In an interview with the Guardian, Facebook?s chief operating officer spoke candidly about dealing with the loss of her husband, Dave Goldberg, who died of a heart attack in 2015 when they were in Mexico for the weekend.?Mark is why I?m walking,? she said. ?Most of what [he and Priscilla] did is not even in the book, because they did so much. When I felt so overwhelmed and so isolated and just needed to cry, I would grab him into his conference room and he would just sit there with me and be like, ?We?re going to get through this and we want to get through it with you?. He did it over and over.?Sandberg?s latest book, Option B, written with psychologist Adam Grant, explores her grief at the loss of Goldberg and acts as a manual for how to build resilience and achieve ?post-traumatic growth?. She wrote the book after posting a highly personal account of her first month as a widow on Facebook. The post attracted a huge outpouring of support and more than 74,000 comments to date. ?After that, I didn?t feel so alone,? she said.Sandberg described how her self-confidence had been shattered after the death of her husband, and that she had needed building up by colleagues including Zuckerberg. She described panicking to him about getting something wrong, and feeling better when he replied: ?Really? I thought you made a good point in that meeting and helped us make a better decision.? The executive, who started dating her old friend and tech billionaire Bobby Kotick 10 months after the death of her husband, also spoke about her anger towards people who judge widows who date again.One Facebook user called her a ?garbage whore?, while another said she was ?one classy lady? for ?already sharing fluids with a nice guy?. ?I?m hoping that this book helps people stop judging people who date [after the loss of a partner], particularly women, because women get judged more harshly,? she said. ?Men date sooner, men date more, and women get judged more. And, you know, obviously that?s super unfair.?She added: ?I think I?m helping people remember that dating, for those that want to do it, is part of moving forward, and it?s option B. If I could, I would only date Dave. I made that choice. I just had it taken away from me.?In the book ? for which she studied the research of behavioural scientists, neurologists and psychologists for tips on how to build resilience ? Sandberg offers practical methods for dealing with grief. These include writing down three joyful experiences and three things done well every day.The author of Lean-In admitted becoming more distanced from friends after the loss of her partner. Asked if she had been let down by loved ones, she replied: ?I don?t know anyone who?s been through this who hasn?t had friends who disappointed them. I think we all go through that.?But the process of dealing with the loss of her husband and best friend had given her life a deeper meaning, and more perspective on life?s difficulties, she said. ?I would definitely choose to be before, so I could get Dave back. I?d give up all the growth. But the deeper sense of meaning, gratitude, purpose ? those things are wonderful things.?Read the full interview and an exclusive extract from Option B in Weekend magazine "

Close to 40 parents had gathered at the Directorate of Medical Education & Research (DMER) on Saturday evening to discuss issues about medical admissions with the officials. ?Based on a recently passed high court order, the DMER has relaxed domicile norms because of which the ranks are very high this year. Students from other states have made it into the state quota merit list while our children are struggling,? said Mahendra Chaudhuri, one of the parents.On July 7, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court relaxed domicile norms for medical and dental aspirants in the state. Originally, those who had cleared Class 10 and 12 from state or had a domicile certificate were eligible for state quota seats.

Our children deserve seats in state institutes,? said Ranjan Mehta, another parent.Parents were also unhappy with DMER?s decision to not release a revised provisional state merit list, after verification of documents of all aspirants. ?Thousands of students apply for seat in Maharashtra medical and dental institutes and document verification will decide whether all those who have applied are eligible for state quota seats. DMER cannot do away with this procedure,? said Mehta. She added that parents have requested DMER to release a final list before the first seat allotment list is out on July 25."
"The police on Tuesday arrested the alleged mastermind, Arjun Thapa, in the Munirka double murder from Agra. His interrogation also led to the recovery of the severed head of one of the two women, whose body was found earlier. A love triangle, a possible sex racket, and Thapa's greed for money were the reasons behind the murders, police said.","summarize: The alleged prime accused in Munirka double murder case, Arjun Thapa, was arrested from Agra on Tuesday. His interrogation led to the recovery of the severed head of Sonam, one of the two women whose decapitated body was pulled out from a sewer on the ground floor of a Munirka building on November 25. Sonam?s head was recovered from another sewer located barely 10 meters away from the building. The head, with scanty skin cover remaining, was stuck inside the vent pipe, police said. Ironically, the police had searched that sewer twice for the missing head after the recovery of Sonam?s body. But the head could not be recovered, as it was stuck inside the plumbing vent. The police had checked only waste-in and waste-out pipes.

It was only when Thapa maintained his claim despite sustained interrogation that the police searched the sewer again and found a third duct where the head was stuck. Thapa?s live-in partner, Mini Sangam aka Neha from Meghalaya, and their cook Jeevan from Nepal, were arrested on December 10 for allegedly killing two freelance spa therapists, Sushma alias Sonam from Assam and Nayesha from Nepal on November 16 and 17.

"Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal has said the government's proposal to auction spectrum every year whether industry needs it or not is ""very progressive thought"". ""In fact, it will become a leading edge practice worldwide,"" Mittal added. Earlier, Telecom Secretary JS Deepak said the government is looking to make spectrum auction an annual event and will seek TRAI's recommendations.","summarize: From Prasoon Srivastava Barcelona, Mar 2 (PTI) The governments proposal to auction spectrum every year has got a backer in Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal, who however has said there is no need for sale of airwaves in coming fiscal. ""The way he (telecom secretary) has put it that spectrum auction will be done every year whether industry needs it or not is very progressive thought. In fact, it will become a leading edge practice worldwide,"" Mittal told PTI in an interview. J S Deepak, as the Telecom Secretary, a couple of days ago said the government is looking at making spectrum auction an annual event and will reach out to sector regulator Trai for its recommendations. He had said the government plans to provide industry with an option to buy spectrum every year irrespective of their interest so that there is never a shortage of spectrum in providing quality mobile services. Deepak, a 1982-batch IAS officer from Uttar Pradesh, who at present is at the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona, has been shifted with ""immediate effect"" from the telecom ministry and made officer on special duty in the commerce department. Mittal recently pitched for affordability in spectrum pricing that has gone ""out of control"" in the last few years, saying the spectrum surplus industry will not need an airwave auction at least in 2017-18. He, however, has said that even though telecom operators are bleeding with the entrance of a new service provider, they will need to increase investment in networks to handle competition. ""You have to accelerate market spends. You need to put more capex. We have done 85,000 base stations last year, 80,000 base stations this year. This is largest rollout anywhere in the world. There will be more investment on 4G side,"" Mittal said. Bharti Airtel had reported an over 54 per cent fall in net profit at Rs 503.7 crore for the December quarter due to what it had termed as ""turbulence from predatory pricing by a new operator"". The Indian telecom czar said Bharti Airtels balancesheet remains ""healthy and strong"" and he does not think Bharti will go into losses under competitive pressure although one can ""never say never"". He maintained that with improvement in technology, the cost of network is not linear. Mittal further said Huawei and ZTE have a massive mimo technology using which one can quadruple or probably go up to 8 times of existing capacities in the spectrum. ""Nice good innovation is happening on the network side where you can generate nice good capacities than in the past. Technology is also coming to help. Its not that if I have got 2000 TB of capacity and I have to move to 5000, I have to double my investments. Its probably 20 per cent more,"" Mittal said. "

"An employer has the sole right, not a court, to decide whether a probationary employee's work was satisfactory or not, the Delhi High Court has said. The court ruled this while upholding the termination of services of a teacher by a private school in the national capital. The teacher's services were terminated in 2014 over his unsatisfactory performance.","summarize: New Delhi, Apr 13 (PTI) An employer, not a court, will decide whether a probationary employees services are satisfactory, the Delhi High Court has said. Justice Valmiki Mehta made the observation while upholding the termination of services of a teacher by a private school in the national capital. ""Whether or not a probationary employees services are satisfactory, it is for the employer to decide ..., and this court cannot substitute its view for that of the employer with respect to satisfactory services or otherwise of employee with the employer,"" the court said. The school had terminated the services of a teacher in March 2014 after keeping him on probation for nearly three years as his work was not found to be satisfactory. The teacher had challenged the decision in the Delhi School Tribunal (DST) which on December 10, 2015 had ruled in his favour by ordering his reinstatement. The school had challenged the DSTs decision in the high court which set aside the tribunals order, holding the termination of his service as valid. It said that since the man, who was appointed on April 4, 2011, did not complete three years of service in the school, he would not be entitled to be confirmed as an employee as was ruled by the Delhi High Court in another matter in 2013. While setting aside the tribunals decision, the high court also expressed surprise as to how the DST avoided direct reference to the 2013 decision of the high court. In its decision of 2013 in another service matter, the high court had held that the maximum period of probation can be three years, six years in gravest of grave cases, and there can be deemed confirmation of services only after that. The teacher was on probation from April 4, 2011 to March 5, 2014 when his services were terminated. He had contended that as per the terms and conditions of his service, the probationary period was not to exceed two years, but he was kept on probation for longer than that. "

With India, the US is building a strategic partnership while with Pakistan the country seeks to have a productive partnership, US officials added.","summarize: By Lalit K Jha                           Washington, Jun 24 (PTI) Asserting that the US ties with India and Pakistan were not a zero-sum game, the White House has said that the Trump administrations priorities and the nature of relationship with the two countries were different. ""We seek to have an effective partnership with each country. With India, were building that strategic partnership. We see Indias role and influence growing. We like to encourage that trend. So, were looking for ways to cooperate on our mutual interests,"" a senior administration official told reporters at a news conference here. ""With Pakistan, we seek to have a productive partnership working together. But frankly, the priorities are different, and the nature of the relationships are different. So, I think that we would like to move forward with both countries. ""We realise that the pace and scope of that relationship is going to be different in each case,"" the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity said in response to a question on concerns in Pakistan with regard to increasing ties with India. Relationship with India and Pakistan is not a zero-sum game, he said. ""I want to make the point here that US relationships with India and Pakistan really stand on their own merits and terms. We dont see a zero-sum relationship when it comes to the US relationship with Pakistan and the US relationship with India. ""Were certainly eager to deepen the strategic partnership with India,"" he said. ""We are also interested in continuing our cooperation with Pakistan,"" the official said adding that the US is concerned about tensions between India and Pakistan. He said the US would like to see the normalisation of relations between the two countries. ""We believe its in both countries interests. Its in the interests of the region, and even the globe, given that theyre both nuclear-weapon powers,"" the official said. ""But we very much encourage India and Pakistan to engage in a direct bilateral dialogue aimed at reducing those tensions,"" the official said while denying reports that sale of high-tech defence items to India would have any adverse impact on Pakistan. ""The US also has a defence partnership with Pakistan. We do cooperate with Pakistan on some security and defence and counter terrorism issues. So again, we dont see this as a zero-sum game,"" the official said. ""We see this as the US and India have mutual security interests that they want to advance, and we believe that the defence sales that are being discussed will help advance those. It is not about Pakistan. ""The defence deals -- we do take into account the regional situation. We very much want to avoid a situation that escalates tensions between the two,"" he said. ""So these issues are taken into account. But some of the defence systems that were talking about we dont believe impact Pakistan. They may be different systems than we are transferring to Pakistan, but we dont believe they represent a threat to Pakistan,"" said the White House official. Meanwhile, a senior Trump official yesterday said that India and the US have a common objective in Afghanistan, and the two countries could increase their cooperation to enhance the Afghan economy. ""India has played a positive role in Afghanistan, the US believes. They have pledged over USD 3 billion in assistance to Afghanistan. The Afghans appreciate the kind of support and assistance that the Indians have provided--Im not just talking about the government, Im talking about the population,"" the official told reporters. ""When theyve done polling, theres a very positive feeling toward India and the kind of assistance -- theyve assisted in the education sector, the health sector. They built the parliament building. They support democracy, democratic development there,"" he said, listing out the developmental activities by India in the war-torn country. ""So I think this administrations opinion is that India has played a helpful role in Afghanistan in helping to stabilise that country, helping to strengthen the government in its fight against the Taliban insurgency. ""Thats the kind of role that the US would like to encourage and perhaps maybe even cooperate in terms of development projects,"" the official said on condition of anonymity. As such, ""this is an area that the two can increase their coordination and their consultation,"" the official said. ""Of course, the US has major assistance programs to Afghanistan as well. So I think this is an area where I think they can expand that dialogue on what they can do to help the economy, help Afghanistan become more self-sufficiently financially. "

"The International Tiger Day, an annual celebration to promote a system for protecting natural habitats of tigers and to raise public awareness for tiger conservation, is celebrated worldwide on July 29. It was first observed in 2010 at the Saint Petersburg Tiger Summit. Reportedly, the world has lost 97% of all wild tigers in a bit over 100 years.","summarize: The global tiger day was created to think of the needs of a wild tiger. Sadly we have forgotten this primary objective. What I am going to do is to spell out the Indian tiger?s wishlist in the hope that those that engage with tigers will rethink and review their strategies.The most important item on the wishlist is to see a mindset change in the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) where this specially created institution starts to imbibe field wisdom about wild tigers through innovative strategies on both protection and tourism. Tigers love well-managed visitors. They keep the forest staff on alert and can provide vital information on illegal grazing, wood felling and poaching. After all, there are hundreds of more eyes and ears looking and hearing. In places where tourism is low, tigers have suffered hugely. The NTCA must learn to respect site-specific initiatives of state governments that can through tourism revenue make our tiger reserves self sufficient. This in turn provides field directors to undertake vital protection work without bureaucratic delays. The NTCA in the last decade has discouraged tourism and endlessly interfered with state government policy seriously impacting the health of tigers. Managing tigers is a state subject and the NTCA must be in the role of facilitator and not policeman.The chief wildlife wardens of the states are vital to the tigers? wishlist. They need to take bold and innovative decisions that inspire the field staff. They need to engage with local communities in the effort to protect tigers. They need to ensure that all vacant positions are filled and chief ministers engaged with all the issues that confront wild tigers. State-of-the-art training is an essential element in the quality of governance that is needed to protect tigers. Retired army officers can instruct on field craft, retired intelligence officials on gathering intelligence on poachers and their syndicates. Our country can offer the best talent to secure the future of wild tigers. Inter-state cooperation is vital to good governance and even more important than linking up with the central government. Rajasthan has held such a meeting with Maharashtra so that both can imbibe best practices from each other. Choose forest staff with care. Good decisions are made by those who spend time understanding tigers. Ignorant decisions damage the future of tigers. The four or five big NGOs must revitalise their thinking and prevent duplication. Focus on specific trouble spots and solve problems with tactical help to the forest staff. Do not beat your own drum. Partner with local communities. The future of tigers will lie in how communities engage in protection. The time for sweet talking them is over. Gather the young and train them into tiger protectors.All this requires strong political will. Tigers need chief ministers at their side. Their instructions are vital to innovative initiatives and this is where strong partnerships between the government and non-governmental sector can trigger the necessary political will. Frequent meetings of the state board of wildlife that chief ministers chair are vital to resolving the tigers? problems.The Prime Minister of the country must play his role for the sake of our national animal. The Prime Minister chairs the national board for wildlife and frequent meetings are a must. The full board has not met for four years. This is the moment to meet and the best experts must apprise the Prime Minister of the tigers? needs.These are the five points on the wish list of India?s wild tigers. And who says it is not possible? Rajasthan has shown the way. Under the supervision of the chief minister, the Ranthambhore tiger reserve has shown the highest amount of tigers ever now touching 65 with the highest tourist revenue now touching 4 million dollars just on entry ticket revenue. It has some of the best local community monitoring and protection and a genuine partnership with field forest staff. It has the best tourism practices and regular monthly meetings of an empowered committee that reports back to the chief minister. For the first time ever, extra tourism revenue is going to new tiger habitats that suffered tremendously due to limited funds.Where there is a will there is a way. It is up to all of us to make it the day of the tiger.Valmik Thapar has worked for 42 years with wild tigers. He has also written 30 books on India?s tigers and wildlife"
"China has deployed a Yuan class-conventional diesel-electric submarine in the Indian Ocean region, its seventh submarine to be deployed in the region. According to the Indian Navy, Chinese warships and submarines in the region appeared in 2013-14. Moreover, it also has its Haiwngxing spy ship deployed which picks up electronic signals that can be returned to Beijing for analysis.","summarize: In an aggressive move, China has deployed a submarine in the Indian Ocean Region, as the month long stand-off in the Doklam plateau between the Indian and Chinese People's Liberation Army continues.Wading through the Indian Ocean now is a Yuan class - conventional diesel electric - submarine which is better that aging Indian Sub. And this is not the first, but the seventh submarine to be deployed in the area.The submarine is being supported by Chinese Naval Ship (CNS) Chongmingdao - the Chinese Navy's submarine support vessel. Indian assets picked up the submarine entering the Indian Ocean Region recently.The Indian Navy has underlined the heightened Chinese People's Liberation Navy activity in the Indian Ocean Region to South Block. Chinese warships and submarines in Indian Ocean Region appeared three years ago 2013-14 - ostensible for anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden.But from a modest beginning of a flotilla of just three warships - two destroyers and a support ship - in 2013-14, more and more Chinese warships are prowling in the waters around India.WAR GAMESRecently, Indian satellites and naval assets have picked up at least 14 Chinese Navy warships in the Indian Ocean Region. These include the latest Luyang-III or the Kunming class stealth destroyers.Armed with surface-air and long range missiles the Chinese warships are projecting power far away from the Beijing's backyard but in India's immediate vicinity. The silver lining - India is constantly monitoring the movement of Chinese warships courtesy Indian satellites and long range maritime surveillance platforms.The Indian Navy's long range surveillance platforms like the US made P81 has been watching and recording movements of the Chinese Navy in the Indian Ocean. ""Over the years, we have augmented our capabilities manifold. More force multipliers are being added. We have the region covered as well,"" a senior officer told India Today.The first Chinese nuclear submarine was picked up in December 2013. The Shang Class- a nuclear propelled submarine-was deployed for almost three months in the waters around India till February 2014.It was followed by Song Class - diesel electric -submarine for another three months between August and December 2014. The Song Class followed by another nuclear vessel - a Han Class nuclear submarine. Last year China deployed a nuclear submarine - a Han Class Nuclear submarine - and a conventional submarine respectively.WORRYING SIGN?These boats were snooped around the Indian Ocean for over six months. The Yuan class submarine detected by the Indian Navy this year is first the submarine to be sent to the Indian Ocean Region in 2017. Worryingly for India, the increased warship deployment goes hand in hand with the deployment of Hydrographic, Oceanographic vessels and spy-ships in the Indian Ocean to map the sea bed.Bathymetric data among other things detail how currents and noise behave at particular depth, the lay of the ocean floor are critical for submarine deployments.Top sources told India Today that Chinese Naval Ship Haiwngxing -spy ship -entered the Indian Ocean this month. The spy ship equipped with sophisticated equipment is deployed to collect electronic intelligence among other things. It is capable of honing on electronic signals which can be returned to China for analysis. New Delhi has been told that the spy ship is the Indian Ocean region to monitor the annual tri-lateral India-USJapan naval exercise - Malabar that starts on July 7. The same ship was used to spy on previous Indo-US Naval exercises.ALSO READ|  Chinese warships frequently visit Karachi, Gwadar in bid to expand presence in Indian Ocean"
"Actress Shabana Azmi has said that filmmakers should decide if they want to cut scenes in their film and not any board. She added that the Censor Board should only certify films and not censor scenes. ""However much you say CBFC?is an autonomous body...people taken on the board...have some kind of affinity with the ruling party,"" added Shabana.","summarize: Amid all the controversy over how much say the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), informally called Censor Board, should have in the final version of a film, veteran actor Shabana Azmi says that the whole system needs a revamp. She believes that filmmakers, not the CBFC, should decide whether any scenes get the chop or not.Talking to Hindustan Times during the Delhi premiere of her latest film, The Black Prince, Shabana was all for overhauling the current system, in which the CBFC has the power to demand cuts in a film before certifying it. ?It?s so wrong to call the CBFC the Censor Board in the first place. It is here to certify films; censoring any scene is not its prerogative,? says the actor. Her reply comes in the context of being asked if she would ever take charge of the Censor Board, as her industry colleagues Asha Parekh, Sharmila Tagore and Anupam Kher have done. The 66-year-old Shabana, who has always been vocal on the issue of censorship, asserts, ?The fact is that the Cinematograph Act of 1952 needs serious revision, and we have to leave it to the filmmakers to decide whether they are open to any cuts in the film or not.??There was the Justice Mukul Mudgal panel, in which Javed [Akhtar] saab was also a member, and they also suggested many changes. So, we are only waiting for those changes to be implemented.?Referring to the Shyam Benegal Committee, which, in its 2016 report,  recommended fairly drastic changes in how the CBFC works, Shabana adds, ?[The committee] has been saying exactly the same thing: that censorship or [the] certifying system needs to change. Even before this committee, there was the Justice Mukul Mudgal panel, in which Javed [Akhtar] saab was also a member, and they also suggested many changes. So, we are only waiting for those changes to be implemented.?Drawing comparisons with the West, Shabana says that the CBFC needs to adopt the American system for film certification and move away from the current British ideology that is being followed.?However much you say that the CBFC?is an autonomous body, the fact is that those people are taken on the board [who] have some kind of affinity with the ruling party.??The system that we follow here for film certification is a British system, wherein you take about 30-odd people from within society and you literally make them sit on judgment to change the morality of the country every five years, according to the political dispensation of that time. Because, however much you say that it?s an autonomous body, the fact is that those people are taken on the board [who] have some kind of affinity with the ruling party, whether it?s the Congress or the BJP. Now, this is not good for any country?s art,? she says.Shedding light on how the Motion Picture Association of America works, Shabana explains, ?I?ve been saying for a long time now that we should follow the American system, where you have a board of people from within the film industry and they decide... the filmmaker decides that ?I don?t want a single cut in my film, but I recognise that it?s not suitable for children, or not suitable for people of [a] certain age, so I am willing to take an XXX certificate.? Or if a filmmaker says that ?No, I want my film for universal release, so I am open to the suggested cuts.?

Gujral has tabled a private member's Bill, the Parliament Enhancement of Productivity Bill, asking for Parliament to must meet at least for 100 days a year.The Bill could not have come at a more opportune moment. Adjournments are fast becoming a norm rather than an aberration. Complete sessions have been washed out without transacting any business inside the Houses and outside a Shiv Sena MP has made the news for beating up an Air India official.Gujral's Bill, if adopted by the government, could go some distance in not only making Parliament a lot more productive but it will also help redeem the MPs in the eye of the public.WHY THE BILL IS SIGNIFICANTIn addition to making it mandatory for Parliament to sit at least for a hundred days a year, spread over four sessions, it also calls for the convening of a special session of both houses for fifteen days. The special session as envisaged by Gujral will not have either the question hour or the zero hour but will be devoted exclusively to taking up two issues of utmost public importance. It has a provision for each political party submitting at least two issues before the business advisory committee that it wants to be taken up in the special session.Significantly at a time when both Houses of Parliament are routinely adjourned or unable to transact any business on account of disruptions. The bill has a provision for compensating the hours lost due to disruptions by adding it to the number of hours that the Houses must sit to make up for the disruptions.

"The Delhi Police is using a new software, which accesses real-time data from its helpline and helps identify crime hotspots. Police can then deploy enough policemen at these places. ""In a mega city, we believe a lot of crimes are predictable and can be curbed,"" said an official. The software will replace manual data gathering, which happens every 15 days.","summarize: It is afternoon. Mandeep Singh Randhawa has just arrived at his office, flanked by two junior officers. Around a dozen men and women wait patiently in a room next to his cabin. A few certificates of merit adorn the walls.?Please give me a few minutes,? Randhwa, deputy commissioner of police (Central Delhi),  tells the visitors and moves straight to his seat and reaches out for the desktop. As he moves the mouse, the monitor, which is on the sleep mode, comes alive with a colourful geospatial map of the area under his control. He zooms in on a micro-scale section of the area, which has crime hots pots marked in red. Randhawa applies a few filters on the new crime-mapping software, and examines the calls made to the police control room about street crimes such as snatching, robbery and vehicle thefts in his territorial district. Pausing for a few moments, he reaches for his wireless handset and connects all ACPs and SHOs of his district one by one.?Deploy two bike patrolling teams on either side of Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg in the press area. There were two snatching and robbery calls between 7 pm and 1 pm last night from the stretch. I don?t want a rerun of the crimes tonight,? he sternly tells the SHO of the IP Estate police station over the wireless set before scrolling through the application again.The DCP has identified the crime hot spot and possibility of any repeat of the crime in the area through a new software called CMAPS (Crime Mapping Analytics and Predictive System). The web-based software accesses real-time data from Delhi Police?s Dial 100 helpline and, using ISRO?s satellite imageries, spatially locates the calls and visualises them as cluster maps to identify crime hot spots.The software?s statistical models and algorithms help the police understand where the next crime is likely to occur. This concept called ?predictive policing? marks a paradigm shift in policing in the national Capital spread across 1,483 square kilometers and divided into 13 police districts, each headed by a DCP. Police get over 27,000 calls on Dial 100 every day on an average. ?We are not predicting the future, what we are predicting is where and when a crime is likely to happen based on scientific and objective analysis of data. And this will determine where our next observations are going to be,? says Sanjay Beniwal, special commissioner of police (operations) sitting in his ninth-floor office at the police headquarters, which gives a panoramic view of the city. ?In a mega city, we believe a lot of crimes are predictable and can be curbed,? he says.CMAPS, which updates the data every three minutes, replaces Delhi Police?s mechanical crime mapping ?which involves manually gathering data at an interval of 15 days. The new software, Beniwal explains, allows the information generated though Dial100 to be plotted on the geospatial map of Delhi, enabling the police to pinpoint exact locations and spatial distribution of the crime. ?We can study the pattern of calls coming from a particular location. Suppose if there are too many robbery calls coming from a location which has a bar nearby, we can match those calls with past crimes in the area and understand if that bar is in any way responsible for these robberies, and whether another crime is likely to occur there,? he says. Many cities such as Los Angeles and Kent in the US, and Berlin in Germany are using predictive policing techniques to prevent crime. In fact, the idea of crime forecasting took shape in 1931 when two Chicago criminologists, Clifford R Shaw and Henry D McKay, conducted a research, exploring the persistence of juvenile crime in some neighbourhoods of the city. They came up with the social disorganisation theory, which states that location matters when it comes to predicting illegal activity.DCP MS Randhawa coordinates police deployment in the Capital on the basis of Crime Mapping Analytics and Predictive System from his office in New Delhi.

						That is when scientists began experimenting with data technologies, including statistical and geospatial analysis, to determine prevalence of crime. The researchers have been using everything from basic regression analysis to cutting-edge mathematical models to predict when and where the next crime is likely to occur. But until recently, the limits of computing power and storage prevented them from using large data sets. What softwares such as CMAPS have done is allow larger data collection, and process it in a much more sophisticated mathematical way ? a significant improvement over just manual hotspot mapping, which Delhi Police have been doing so far.But statistical model-based predictive policing has raised concerns in the West that it might create prejudices against particular communities or areas and how much power should be accorded to computer algorithms.?Any statistical model can be flawed, but we hope it will be too dynamic to hold any area guilty of a crime for long,? says Beniwal. ?The web-based software will soon be available on mobile and even a beat constable will have maps showing locations where crime is likely to occur,? says an officer. ?It is all about using science to curb crime,? says Beniwal.WHAT IS PREDICTIVE POLICINGPredictive policing is the application of data analytical techniques to identify likely targets for police intervention and prevent crimes by making statistical predictions. A crime forecasting software involves statistical models and algorithmsHow it works 1 Predective policing starts with collecting large amounts of data on past crime and co-relating them with present crimes.

","summarize: Vatican authorities have turned off 100 fountains, including two Baroque masterpieces in St. Peter?s Square, due to a prolonged drought affecting the tiny city state and the city of Rome, which surrounds it. Suffocating summer heat has followed two years of lower-than-average rainfall in Rome, forcing the Italian capital to close drinking fountains and consider the prospect of water rationing.More than a million residents of Rome are facing water rationing for up to eight hours a day as the prolonged heatwave that has ravaged southern Europe takes its toll. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said it was the first time authorities in the spiritual home of the world?s 1.2 billion Catholics could remember being forced to turn off the fountains. Standing in St Peter?s Square, where two fountains by 17th-century sculptors Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini stood dry, Burke said the Vatican wanted to help. ?This is the Vatican?s way of living in solidarity with Rome, trying to help Rome get through this crisis,? he told Reuters TV.The measure was initiated on Monday, and all 100 Vatican fountains will be turned off gradually over the coming days. Rome is gasping after 72% less rain than normal fell in July, according to Sky Italia?s weather TV channel. There was 74% less than normal in June, and a 56% reduction from the long-term average across March, April and May. Caring for the planet and its resources is an important issue for Pope Francis, who demanded swift action by world leaders in the first ever papal document dedicated to the environment. ?This decision is very much in line with the pope?s thinking on ecology: you can?t waste and sometimes you have to be willing to make a sacrifice,? Burke said. "

"The Indian Air Force on Sunday rescued a pregnant woman, newborn twins and their mother from a flooded village in Gujarat. The village was inaccessible through roads due to heavy rainfall and floods. An official said a Chetak helicopter reached the location within 45 minutes of receiving the evacuation request and flew them to a medical team waiting for them.","summarize: Acting with lightening speed - peculiar to the Men in Blue and their flying machines, an Indian Air Force Chetak helicopter took flight within minutes of the IAF receiving a request for immediate evacuation of two pregnant women in critical condition, 'about to deliver'.The message with the location details was received at 4:30pm and the Chetak got airborne from Jamnagar at 4:40pm to head for the site.It took barely anytime for the seasoned heads and hands at work at HQ Southern Western Air Command  Gandhinagar coordinating Human Assistance and Disaster Relief operations in the area in choosing a Chetak helicopter for this particular operation - owing to its much lesser all up weight as compared to a MI-17V5. Keeping in view - the medical condition of those to be evacuated, the aircraft would need to land to take them on board safely (in all probability on a patch of soft ground as reported by district officials at the site).While the aircraft was enroute to Nana Matra Village of Vinchia Taluka in Rajkot district - the district administration officials informed that one of the two women to be evacuated had already delivered a set of twins and needed to be airlifted immediately. By 5:15pm, the 'Saviour Chetak' was already overhead looking for a safe patch to land. The mother, with her new born twins and an attendant were instantaneously put into the aircraft and flown out to safety with due care. The aircraft landed at Jasdan helipad where they were handed over to the medical team already waiting for the aircraft on ground.The aircraft then returned to Nana Matra, this time picking up another pregnant woman bleeding profusely, in need of urgent medical attention. The lady along with an attendant was quickly evacuated and flown across the river where the medical staff and ambulance in wait took over.It is learnt that due to excessive flooding and damage to the access road, the village Nana Matra had become inaccessible for vehicles necessitating timely aerial evacuation by IAF to save previous lives.ALSO READ:IAF turns 83: PM Modi salutes Air Force's courage, determinationIndian Air Force plans to add muscle to SukhoisSukhoi-30 crash: Pilots onboard IAF aircraft confirmed dead, were unable to eject on timeALSO WATCH: Road rage shocker: IAF officer thrashed and robbed by 3 men in Delhi, video goes viral "

"UK's National Health Service (NHS) has announced plans to stop doctors from prescribing homeopathic remedies. Aiming to save around £200 million a year, the NHS chief described homeopathy as ?at best a placebo and a misuse of funds?. The plans also list 17 other items that will no longer be prescribed for reasons ranging from low clinical to low cost-effectiveness.","summarize: Homeopathic remedies will no longer be available on prescription on the NHS according to newly-announced plans.The move comes as part of the NHS England?s drive to save more than £190m a year through a new set of national guidelines, which are now open for public consultation. According to the draft consultation, prescriptions for homeopathic treatments cost NHS England £92,412 in 2016, and at least £578,000 over the past five years.Announcing the plans, Simon Stevens, NHS England?s chief executive, said homeopathy is ?at best a placebo and a misuse of scarce NHS funds?.Besides homeopathy, the plans highlight 17 other items that will no longer be available on prescription for reasons ranging from low clinical effectiveness to low cost-effectiveness. These include herbal medicines, Omega-3 fatty acid compounds, rubs and ointments used to relieve muscle pain known as rubefacients, and travel vaccines including hepatitis B, yellow fever and rabies that are not available on the NHS for travel, but are sometimes erroneously given.The public funding of homeopathic remedies has long been controversial, with both the British Medical Association and the House of Commons? science and technology committee having called for an end to their prescription on NHS, pointing out that such remedies are merely placebos. The new guidelines were welcomed by experts.?Homeopathy is based on implausible assumptions and the most reliable evidence fails to show that it works beyond a placebo effect. It can cause severe harm when used as an alternative to effective treatments,? said Edzard Ernst, emeritus professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter. ?Therefore, it is high time that the NHS stops funding it and instead employs our scarce resources on treatments that are backed by sound science.?The view was echoed by Michael Marshall, project director of the Good Thinking Society, an organisation that previously threatened the Department of Health with a judicial review if it failed to put complementary and alternative therapies on the blacklist for prescriptions.?This is very welcome news,? said Marshall. ?Every credible medical body certainly knows that homeopathic remedies are just not effective for any conditions at all and it is great to see this strong statement from NHS England officially acknowledging the fact.? Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, said that an honest conversation about public funding of drugs was needed. ?We need to end unnecessary expense to give us a bigger therapeutic bang for the NHS buck, so we cut the fat and build the therapeutic muscle,? he said.A spokeswoman for the BMA said the organisation ?believes there should be no further NHS funding for homeopathy? adding that ?limited and scarce NHS resources should only be used to support medicines and treatment that have been shown to be effective.?But Cristal Sumner, chief executive of the British Homeopathic Association said the NHS plans were ?bad for its already overstretched budget and for patients? and criticised the report used to draw up the new guidelines.?This recommendation is not cost effective as patients will be prescribed more expensive conventional drugs in place of homeopathy, which defeats the object of the exercise,? she said.Meanwhile, NHS England has been accused of introducing ?ability to pay? through the back door by forcing patients to pay for other products it claims are ?ineffective, over-priced and low value?, instead of giving prescriptions for them. Health charities claim the NHS is abandoning the historic principle that people who need care should not have to pay. The charge has been made today by National Voices, an umbrella group that represents 140 health and care charities including the British Heart Foundation, Parkinson?s UK and Arthritis Care. It was responding to NHS England?s announcement that it wants to cut its drugs bill by several hundred million pounds by no longer issuing prescriptions for cough mixture, cold treatments, eye drops, laxatives and sun cream ? products that are available over the counter. NHS bosses want those in need to pay for such medications themselves. ?There are many patients who would be unable to afford the remedies over the counter ? for example people who are exempt from prescription charges such as the under-16s, people living with cancer, pregnant women and those on low incomes?, said Don Redding, National Voices? director of policy. ?Stopping such prescriptions would be tantamount to introducing ?ability to pay? as a barrier to accessing the treatments people need. This breaks with the principle of ?free at the point of use? guaranteed by the NHS constitution.? The NHS constitution states that: ?Access to NHS services is based on clinical need, not an individual?s ability to pay; NHS services are free of charge, except in limited circumstances sanctioned by parliament.?

"A diamond ring is expected to fetch £350,000 (?3 crore) at an auction in London, 30 years after its owner bought it for £10 (?900), thinking it was a costume jewel. The owners wore the 26.27-carat diamond for decades, only learning its value after a jeweller said it could be valuable.

The owner, unaware of its value, wore it for decades, while doing everything from the shopping to the chores.The 26.27-carat, cushion-shaped, white diamond, snapped up at a Sunday sale at the West Middlesex hospital in Isleworth in west London in the 1980s, is going under the hammer at Sotheby?s on 7 June. The head of the auction house?s London jewellery department, Jessica Wyndham, said: ?The owner would wear it out shopping, wear it day-to-day. It?s a good-looking ring. But it was bought as a costume jewel. No one had any idea it had any intrinsic value at all. They enjoyed it all this time.?They had been to quite a few car boot sales over the years. But they don?t have any history of collecting antiques and they don?t have any history of collecting diamonds. This is a one-off windfall, an amazing find.?Wyndham said that after about 30 years of wearing the ring, the owners brought it into Sotheby?s after a jeweller told them it could have substantial value.?They came in with the idea that it might be real and they had no idea of its value,? she said. ?We had a look and said ? I think that?s a diamond, and we got it tested at the Gemological Institute of America. The majority of us can?t even begin to dream of owning a diamond that large.?

No matter what your background is or what your past experiences have been, it?s going to revolutionise someone?s life?.The diamond is thought to have been cut in the 19th century but its history and how it arrived at the car boot sale are unknown.Wyndham said the older style of diamond cutting was ?slightly duller and deeper than you would see in a modern style ? it could trick people into thinking it?s not a genuine stone?.She added: ?The diamond cutter is looking to maximise the amount of brilliance from the stone because that?s what makes it sparkly,? she said.?With an old style of cutting, an antique cushion shape, the light doesn?t reflect back as much as it would from a modern stone cutting. Cutters worked more with the natural shape of the crystal, to conserve as much weight of the crystal rather than make it as brilliant as possible. The older stones have quite a bit of personality. They sparkle in a different way.??Serendipity? may have prompted the owners to buy the ring in the first place, she said, ?but a 26-carat, cushion-shaped diamond, no matter how filthy or dark that mount was, maybe that stone still speaks to people.

"The Samajwadi Party has called UP CM Yogi Adityanath's government an ""inquiry committee"" after the CBI started investigating nearly half a dozen projects launched by former CM Akhilesh Yadav. ""It's engaging in politics of vendetta, and more so to smokescreen its failures in delivering on the pre-poll promises,"" chief SP spokesperson Rajendra Chowdhury said.","summarize: By Abhinav Pandey Lucknow, Jun 25 (PTI) With nearly half a dozen projects launched by former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav under the CBI scanner, the SP has attacked the Adityanath government saying it has reduced itself into an ""inquiry committee"". As the states BJP government completes 100 days in the office in the next few days, a Samajwadi Party spokesperson said it was resorting to such tactics to ""smokescreen its failures"". ""It smacks of politics of vendetta,"" partys chief spokesperson Rajendra Chowdhury told PTI here. It reflects that the state government relies more on central investigating agencies, like the CBI, than on its own machinery for carrying out any probe, he alleged. Since taking office on March 19, the Adityanath government has recommended CBI probes into several projects of the previous Samajwadi Party regime led by Akhilesh Yadav. These include alleged irregularities in the functioning of Shia and Sunni waqf boards, Akhileshs dream project of Gomti riverfront development, mobile creche scheme, and also into the death of Karnataka-based IAS officer Anurag Tiwari in Lucknow last month. Besides, acting on an Allahabad High Court directive, the state government has recommended a CBI probe into alleged irregularities in the construction of Delhi-Saharanpur Yamunotri highway. ""It seems the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh has become an inquiry committee. Its engaging in politics of vendetta, and more so to smokescreen its failures in delivering on the pre-poll promises,"" Chowdhury said. In its probe into alleged irregularities in the Yamunotri highway construction, the UP Police found out that Rs 455 crore were siphoned off by a Hyderabad-based firm, which undertook the project, in connivance with staff of 14 banks and some chartered accountants (CAs). It told the government that since offices of the financial institutions, the CAs and the construction firms were located in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and other parts of the country, it would be better to get it probed by some central agency. After an internal probe, a CBI inquiry was recommended last month, Principal Secretary (Home) Arvind Kumar said. The CBI has also registered an FIR to probe alleged irregularities of funds into the Rs 1,100-crore Sachal Palnagriha Yojana (mobile creche). The scheme was launched by the Akhilesh government to provide creche facilities to children, aged six and below, of women labourers engaged in the construction sector. The scheme, supposed to involve NGOs, aimed at providing nutritious food, entertainment and educational facilities to children. It is alleged that officials of the states Social Welfare, Building and Constructions Department connived with NGOs to divert funds. The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court had handed over the case to the CBI, saying there was a need to probe the alleged misappropriation and defalcation of public money during the implementation of the scheme. The court had observed the state government departments were ""shifting blame"" onto each other. The CBI has booked unidentified officials of the UP State Social Welfare Board, the UP Building and Construction Workers? Welfare Board and several NGOs in this case. ""The CM does not trust his own police when it comes to probe. The Adityanath government seems to rely more on CBI than on Uttar Pradesh police,"" the SP spokesperson said. The state government also recommended a CBI probe into the alleged irregularities in the working of the Shia and Sunni waqf boards. UP MoS for Waqf Mohsin Raza said the alleged scam came to the fore in a probe by the Waqf Council of India (WCI). The role of Shia Waqf Boards chairman Wasim Rizvi and that of the Minister for Waqf in the SP government Azam Khan have also come under the scanner after the WCI inquiry. Khan has, however, maintained he is ""absolutely clean"" and the allegations against him were baseless. The UP government is also contemplating to recommend a CBI probe into various anomalies in the Gomti Riverfront Development Project- a dream project of former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. ""Just a couple of days back, a (Gomti Riverfront) probe report was submitted to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. All necessary steps will be taken and appropriate action initiated for a CBI probe,"" MoS, Urban Development, Girish Kumar Yadav told PTI. On April 1, the chief minister had ordered an inquiry by a retired high court judge in the project. The decision came after urban development officials told the CM that of the total allocation of Rs 1,513 crore, 95 per cent (around Rs 1,435 crore) had already been spent but less than 60 per cent of the work has been completed. Some other SP government projects under the scanner are land acquisition for Agra-Lucknow expressway, the Yash Bharti awards Samajwadi pension scheme, ration cards distribution, claiming ""fake"" fix deposits to get PWD contracts in Etah.

"Chelsea and England legend Frank Lampard ended his 21-year professional football career after announcing his retirement on Thursday. The 38-year-old, who scored a club-record 211 goals for Chelsea, won a Champions League title alongside winning three Premier League titles with the Blues. The midfielder won 106 caps for England and scored over 300 goals in his career.","summarize: It is a moment that is seared on to the consciousness of Frank Lampard and every Chelsea fan ? particularly those who were there. Bolton Wanderers away; 30 April 2005. Lampard surges around one opponent, cuts inside another and thrashes a low shot into the net.If Chelsea win, they win the league title. For the first time since 1955. And in their centenary year, too. Lampard has set them on their way and the celebrations that follow are frenzied. He is buried beneath a scrum of team-mates. Even some of the substitutes jump on.Lampard is not finished. On a quick break, he finds himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper. He walks the ball around him to make it 2-0. Game over. Chelsea are the champions. Lampard is a champion. Not bad for a player who they said would not make it to the top.He was not finished. It was the second major honour of his career, following on from the League Cup triumph in February of that year and Lampard would go on to claim 11 of them ? all with his beloved Chelsea, the club he joined from West Ham United in 2001. The highlight, surely, was the Champions League final in 2012, when he captained Chelsea, in the absence of the suspended John Terry, to the penalty shootout victory against Bayern Munich.Now, Lampard is finished. At the age of 38 and after 21 years in the professional game, he has decided to retire. He does so with three Premier League titles to his name; four FA Cups; two League Cups; the Champions League and the Europa League. In other words, the clean sweep at club level.With England, it never went to plan, although he is hardly the only player who can say that. He was excellent at Euro 2004, scoring three times as England reached the quarter-finals but his subsequent tournament appearances at the World Cups of 2006, 2010 and 2014 were disappointments.Lampard missed his penalty in the quarter-final shootout defeat against Portugal in 2006 and, four years later, his glorious shot in the last 16 against Germany bounced off the crossbar and over the line ? except that the officials ruled it as no goal. It would have made the score 2-2. Instead, England slumped to a 4-1 defeat.In many respects, it summed up how Lampard?s international career, which yielded 106 caps and 29 goals, came down on the wrong side of the margins. It was shaped by his relationship in central midfield with Steven Gerrard, or the lack of one. The Lampard-Gerrard conundrum was debated endlessly.Nevertheless, Lampard goes down as a Premier League great and he owes it all to his phenomenal work ethic and mental toughness; the desire that he has always had to prove his worth ? and others wrong.?When Frank was a youngster, I can remember a lot of people saying: ?What?s all the fuss? He?s a good player but he isn?t that good,? says Tony Carr, the former West Ham academy director, under whom Lampard developed. ?He never got to play for England schoolboys and I can remember Harry Redknapp, the West Ham manager, asking me why Frank wasn?t playing for England youth, when he was a youth-team player at the club.?Harry rang the England coach, who was Dave Burnside, and Dave said: ?We know about him but we think we?ve got better.? That sort of thing was a fantastic spur for Frank. With his bloody?mindedness, his dedication, the way he constantly tried to improve himself ? he made himself the ultimate pro. I?ve got nothing but complete admiration for him.?As the tributes came in on Thursday, the one from Terry stood out. Lampard?s long-time Chelsea team?mate described him as a gentleman and a leader. But Terry also made reference to how Lampard had wrung every last drop from his talent. ?You were the best trainer by a million miles every single day, inspiring me and everyone at the club,? Terry wrote. ?You stayed out [after training] working on your finishing ? 20 goals a year wasn?t good enough for you; you wanted 25, 30 goals. I will miss you getting four cones and doing sprints after training ? setting the example for the academy kids.?Lampard is synonymous with consistency and durability; only Ryan Giggs and Gareth Barry have made more Premier League appearances than his 609 while his run of 164 consecutive matches remains a record for an outfield player. He read the game with intelligence ? this is a man who recorded one of Britain?s highest Mensa scores ? and it is questionable whether he got the credit he deserves for his exceptional short and long passing.In the end, though, Lampard was defined by his goals; the timing of the runs, the technique and the power of the execution. He says the two at Bolton were his best with the one he scored for Chelsea at Aston Villa in 2013, which took him past Bobby Tambling?s all-time record for the club, not far behind.When Lampard left Chelsea in 2014 to finish his career at Manchester City and New York City, he did so with 211 goals from 649 appearances for them. It is doubtful whether the mark will be overhauled. In terms of the Premier League, only Alan Shearer, Wayne Rooney and Andy Cole have scored more than his 177 goals and they, of course, are strikers.His numbers are mind?boggling and Terry, Tambling and others have described him as Chelsea?s greatest player. His next move looks likely to be into coaching. Whatever he does, Lampard will give it his all."
"USA's Caeleb Dressel won three gold medals within 90 minutes at the World Aquatics Championships on Saturday, to become the world's first swimmer to ace three events on a single night at a world meet. Dressel's medal haul comprised individual golds in 50-metre freestyle and 100-metre butterfly, besides a world record-breaking performance in the 4x100-metre mixed freestyle relay.","summarize: Caeleb Dressel knows the comparisons are coming.After pulling off an unprecedented Triple Crown at swimming?s world championships, it?s time to take on the legacy of Michael Phelps.The 20-year-old Dressel established himself as America?s newest star of the pool Saturday, becoming the first swimmer to win three gold medals on a single night at either the worlds or the Olympics.Not even Phelps managed such an audacious feat.Dressel won the 50m freestyle and the 100m butterfly before leading off a world-record performance in the 4x100-meter mixed freestyle relay.?The comparisons are probably inevitable,? Dressel said. ?But I?m not the same person as Michael.?Yet it was downright Phelps-like the way he pulled off a remarkable night of swimming at Duna Arena. Dressel raced three times over the course of about two hours ? and won every time. Not to mention, he had to find time to warm down and get to three medal ceremonies.?I think I only had to run twice,? Dressel said with a smile.The University of Florida student ? yep, he?s got an algebra exam coming up Monday that he?ll be taking online ? has won six golds medals in Budapest.That gives him a shot at moving into more rarified territory: Phelps is the only swimmer to win seven golds at a world championships, which he did at Melbourne in 2007 as a prelude to his record eight golds the following year at the Beijing Olympics.Dressel will be a virtual lock to win his seventh when he competes on the 4x100 medley relay Sunday, the final event of the championships.Again, those comparisons to Phelps.?It?s a tough question,? Dressel said. ?I don?t know if I welcome them. But I know they?re going to come. I don?t think it puts any pressure on me. I just want to keep doing my thing at this meet and for the future.?Phelps was certainly impressed and texted his congratulations shortly after the relay event. ?This kid is on fire!!? Phelps wrote on Instagram, including a picture of him celebrating with Dressel during a gold medal-winning relay they were both on last summer at the Rio Olympics. ?So damn fun to watch buddy!!!!?Dressel started the night with a furious dash from one end of the pool to the other, adding the 50 free world title to the 100 free he already had. He came back about a half-hour later to nearly break Phelps? world record in the 100 fly, posting a time of 49.86 that was just four-hundredths off the mark set in 2009 at the rubber suit-aided championships in Rome.The final relay was merely a coronation, the Americans romping to gold in 3 minutes, 19.60 seconds ? eclipsing by nearly 3 1/2 seconds the mark they set two years ago at worlds.?Man, that was a lot of fun,? Dressel said.He even managed to overshadow Katie Ledecky, who won her fifth gold medal of the meet by cruising to victory in the 800 free. Yet Budapest will be remembered as bit of a disappointment for the star of the 2016 Summer Games, who settled for silver in the 200 free and didn?t come close to breaking any of her personal bests.Ledecky won in 8:12.68, which was nearly eight seconds off her world record at Rio de Janeiro.?I?ve never walked away from a season completely satisfied, even last year,? she said. ?I can really take what I?ve learned and use it moving forward. It gets me really excited. If that was my bad year for the next four years, then the next couple years are going to be pretty exciting.?Sweden?s Sarah Sjostrom was another standout, bouncing back from a disappointing loss the previous night to win gold in the 50 fly and set a world record in the semifinals of 50 free. Her time of 23.67 broke the mark of 23.73, set in 2009 by Britta Steffen.In the women?s 200 backstroke, Emily Seebohm of Australia shrugged off the roaring Hungarian crowd to take gold over home-country favorite Katinka Hosszu.Sjostrom set her second world record of the meet, having already established a new standard in the 100 free while swimming the leadoff leg of the 4x100 free relay.But even the Swedish star took note of Dressel?s performance.?I don?t even know if he went to the Olympics last year,? she said. ?He took a really big step this year as we can see. It?s really impressive, really cool to see.?Indeed, Dressel has emerged as the breakout performer of these championships, with a bit of help from the relatively new mixed relays. Two of his golds came in events that feature men and women on the same team, races Phelps never competed in at worlds.?It?s crazy,? Dressel said. ?But I had mixed relays helping me out, so it?s a bit different.?Yet no less impressive.Dressel led off the mixed free relay with a blistering time of 47.22 for the first 100 ? even more remarkable given what he?d already been through ? and his three teammates ? Nathan Adrian, Mallory Comerford and Simone Manuel ? took it from there.?That last relay was a lot of fun,? Dressel said. ?I wanted to lead it off even though it meant less to get ready for it. It was such a blast.?The whole night was.?I haven?t had much time to think,? Dressel said, pondering the significance of it all. ?As physically demanding as it is, mentally it?s even more straining. So I have 24 hours until my next swim. I?ll give myself 30 minutes tonight to, I guess, let it sink in a bit, then it?s time to refocus for that relay tomorrow.?"

The invite, which also carries a photo of Donald Trump as a child (it's real), doesn't mention what the festivities at Jantar Mantar will entail. But, the invite does promise a photo exhibition, presumably on the life and times of President Trump.Also, if the Hindu Sena's Trump birthday celebration from last year is to be considered, there will be a decorative cake involved. This is not the first time the Hindu Sena has organised an event around Donald Trump, who turns 70 today. In May last year, the group held a havan, again at Jantar Mantar, praying for Donald Trump's victory in the then upcoming United States presidential election.Later that year in November, just days before the US election, the Hindu Sena pre-emptively celebrated the Republican Trump's victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. MEANWHILE, IN THE USWhile the Hindu Sena is organising a birthday party for Trump at New Delhi's favourite protest site, there is an actual march being planned in New York City to protest the US president's very birth.A group called Rise and Resist, which was formed after Trump was voted to power in November last year, has called on citizens in New York City to march to Trump Tower and hold demonstrations. The group also plans to give him a gift: a plane ticket to Russia (the Trump campaign is being investigated for colluding with the Russian government during the US presidential election).

The doorway opens into a courtyard surrounded by corridors and has two rooms in the extreme corner on the left. Villagers were confined in these two rooms if they were not able to pay up zaildari tax. The compound, flanked by modern-day houses still has old peepal, banyan, and neem trees.The complex housed one of the four zails (administrative units tasked with revenue collection) in Delhi. Revenue defaulters were also imprisoned here and so it came to be known as Bawana Jail.It was constructed in the 1860s when the zaildari system (revenue collection plan) was introduced. The in-charge of the jail was called zaildar or numberdar. Three villages ? Bawana, Alipur, and Kanjhawala were under its jurisdiction. Bawana tehsil was among the four administrative divisions with Mehrauli, Dilli, and Najafgarh.Next to the rooms is a small staircase, which leads to the terrace. There are bastions on all four corners on the terrace, which were used as guard posts too.?There used to be a small well inside the complex but it was filled long back. Later on, the water turned salty hence was not being used for drinking. I remember, children stumbled upon old coins when they would play on the premises,? says Master Dhani Ram (85), a retired headmaster, who studied at the school from 1942 to 1947.Over the yearsAround the 1930-40s, the building was converted into a school, which continued after the Partition. For a brief period, it served as a veterinary hospital. Later, it was converted into an orphanage, which was closed in 1981. When Sahib Singh Verma became the chief minister of Delhi, it served as patwari office (official who maintains land records) for some time.Since then the structure was abandoned and dilapidating. A major portion of walls was missing from the outer and inner face. The parapet also collapsed.In 2004, the Delhi government?s archaeology department carried out restoration of the historical site along with two dozen other monument across the city. The government also planned to convert it into a freedom fighter?s museum then. The proposal never materialised. Another failed attempt to conserve it was made in 2010 as it was to be showcased during the Commonwealth Games.?After its renovation, the government should maintain it. This will help glorify the contribution of Bawana in the making of Delhi,? Ram says.A senior official of the archaeology department, however, said the priority is to preserve the heritage.A glimpse into the history Bawana was established in 1168. It is believed that Jats came to settle here from Taoru, now in Haryana. Before making Bawana their final abode, they spent considerable time at Mehrauli too.Bawana was a cluster of 52 villages (Narela-17, Karala -17, Palam-6, and Bawana-12) with vast agricultural lands sprawled in about 52,000 acres. The village derived its name from the word ?Bawan?, which means 52 in Hindi. A plaque installed above the entrance of the tehsil reads: ?From the zails of Bawana, Kanjhaola, and Alipur, 1,231 men went to the great war (first World War, 1914-1919). Of these, 81 gave up their lives.? "

"A group of women working at a pub in Gurugram beat up around a dozen men making obscene gestures at them outside a mall at night. The men approached two of the women, and tried to pull one of them towards the car they came in. They fled after the women took off their slippers and beat them up.","summarize: Not unfamiliar with late-hour spectacles, Gurgaon's Mall Mile, a one-km stretch dotted with shopping malls and night clubs, was witness to yet another eventful night on Saturday - albeit with a twist. A group of women pub workers, fed up with obscene gestures and physical assault by a few men, took out their slippers to teach their tormentors a lesson.The brawl was captured by several onlookers on their mobile phones and these clips are now in circulation on social media. The half-hour high drama makes a mockery of Gurugram Police's claims of night patrol at the stretch, which has been in news for open sex trade and crimes against women.MISSING POLICE PRESENCE""There was hardly any police presence on MG Road when this incident happened. Onlookers were busy shooting the fight on their cameras,"" BN Lal, an eye-witness and a resident of the area, told Mail Today. ""While sex deals taking place on the (MG) road are an open secret, police patrolling is seen only after a major crime is highlighted in the media. A few weeks later, it is business as usual,"" Lal added. Several eyewitnesses said the ""ugly episode"" took place around 1 AM when a group of four to five women, apparently working with the various pubs in the vicinity, were waiting outside Sahara Mall for transport. ""Some drunk men repeatedly made obscene gestures to the women and one of them approached them. This was followed by heated arguments and commotion, which made the men leave the spot,"" said one of the eyewitnesses, requesting anonymity.""However, these men, about a dozen in count, returned five-ten minutes later and again approached one of the younger women in the group,"" said the eyewitness. ""They must have been emboldened by the absence of any police patrol vehicle in the area.""Lal said a fresh round of arguments began after which one of the men tried to pull one of the women to where his vehicle was parked. The scuffle sparked anxiety among other women who rushed to help their colleague.SLIPPERS FLY""One of them took out his slipper and waved at the assailant. In a flash, all the women took off their footwear and began beating up the harasser. His friends came to help him but they also received the same treatment,"" Lal said. ""As a crowd gathered, the men ran away in their vehicles.""There are seven night clubs in Sahara Mall and each has the capacity of hosting about 100 guests. Local residents complain that at 1 AM, when these pubs down shutters, MG road gets crowded with groups of drunk men who are a nuisance. ""The situation is worst on weekends,"" said a resident.A security guard at the mall, who refused to be named, said when the patrons come out of these night clubs, they try to strike deals with women, some of whom are regular employees and others who facilitate entry to stag pub-goers. ""Such brawls usually occur when either a deal goes wrong or regular women employees are inappropriately approached. The Saturday incident seems to be the latter case,"" said the guard. ""When Gurgaon Police are around, there is little nuisance but when the patrol party is absent, such arguments are common. Only this time, the molesters were at the receiving end,"" the guard added.There are 15 night clubs in various malls on the stretch. Residents said they have approached the district administration but it has failed to come with an effective strategy to deal with the weekly ruckus. ""Pub owners must be held accountable for such incidents. They must ensure that female guests or staff leave their premises safely,"" said a local resident.City police tried to wash their hands of the matter by saying that such incidents were more of a social problem then a crime.

Coming from Delhi, the aggression and extreme passion for the game came naturally to him which reflected in his game as well.Sehwag though, was quite the opposite even though he hails from the same state. The Nawab of Najafgarh was always seen as a jovial character who used to sing songs while batting and made light work of the high-class bowling that he faced during his illustrious career. Even now in his career as a broadcaster, Sehwag is hilarious with his commentary and doesn't like to mince his words.Sehwag, in a recent show with Star Sports, narrated a particular story about Kohli where he revealed how he used to behave like a shy youngster in front of the seniors but was the complete opposite during his U-19 days.""He was a shy and quite youngster in front of us senior players but when he was in the U-19 team he used to be very very naughty. I've heard a lot of stories about how naughty he was him from his U-19 coach Ajit Chaudhary.""Once Chaudhary told me that Kohli fell ill or was play acting so his coach told him that he wouldn't play in the next match. And suddenly Kohli's fever went away and he became absolutely fine after hearing that, started batting normally the way he does in the nets also. He played the next match and smashed a double hundred,"" Sehwag told Star Sports in an interview.Sehwag also recalled the time he heard about Kohli for the first time and what he thought of the future India captain the first time he saw him bat live."

Some Internet companies say it is impossible to block all such sites because many of the servers that host them are outside India. Also, the sites can still be accessed through proxy servers.However, researchers from Australia's University of Melbourne found in a study last month that young people who watch pornography, which is now easily accessible on smartphones and other devices, are more likely to sexually abuse another child or young person.Referring to ""increasing"" instances where auto drivers, bus drivers and conductors indulge in molestation and sodomy, the affidavit says, ""Limited access to persons making request to visit porn sites, may be provided (like VPN gateway server, etc) with certain conditions like: Instead of making payment to the Service providers, a hefty amount be made to the Government of India. This way, it is reflected in the bank accounts; also people like auto-drivers and people belonging to such similar strata of the society will have restricted access to online pornography.

"British publication The Guardian has admitted its January 2017 report on a loophole in WhatsApp's security system was incorrect. The report had claimed that the backdoor lets the Facebook-owned chat app intercept and read users' encrypted messages. The newspaper has said that ""misinterpretations, mistakes and misunderstandings"" happened at several stages of the article's reporting process.","summarize: The Guardian was wrong to report in January that the popular messaging service WhatsApp had a security flaw so serious that it was a huge threat to freedom of speech.But it was right to bring to wide public notice an aspect of WhatsApp that had the potential to make some messages vulnerable to being read by an unintended recipient.The Guardian did not test with an appropriate range of experts a claim that had implications for the more than one billion people who use the Facebook-owned WhatsApp.In a detailed review I found that misinterpretations, mistakes and misunderstandings happened at several stages of the reporting and editing process. Cumulatively they produced an article that overstated its case.The Guardian ought to have responded more effectively to the strong criticism the article generated from well-credentialled experts in the arcane field of developing and adapting end-to-end encryption for a large-scale messaging service.The original article ? now amended and associated with the conclusions of this review ? led to follow-up coverage, some of which sustained the wrong impression given at the outset. The most serious inaccuracy was a claim that WhatsApp had a ?backdoor?, an intentional, secret way for third parties to read supposedly private messages. This claim was withdrawn within eight hours of initial publication online, but withdrawn incompletely. The story retained material predicated on the existence of a backdoor, including strongly expressed concerns about threats to freedom, betrayal of trust and benefits for governments which surveil. In effect, having dialled back the cause for alarm, the Guardian failed to dial back expressions of alarm.This made a relatively small, expert, vocal and persistent audience very angry. Guardian editors did not react to an open letter co-signed by 72 experts in a way commensurate with the combined stature of the critics and the huge number of people potentially affected by the story. The essence of the open letter and a hyperlink to it were added to the article, but wider consultation and a fundamental reconsideration of the story were needed.The aspect of WhatsApp at the heart of this matter, put very simply, is as follows. When a user of WhatsApp is offline, any messages at that time in transit to him or her are held in Facebook?s servers. (If unclaimed after 30 days they are deleted, Facebook advised.) If, while offline, the recipient registers a new device, any messages waiting for the person on Facebook?s servers are no longer deliverable because they are encrypted for the person?s old device. To prevent those messages from being lost, when the intended recipient comes back online, any in-transit messages are re-encrypted with the new device?s key and resent automatically. If senders have turned on a notification setting in WhatsApp on their phone, they are told that the key has changed, but not otherwise.Critics said that the Guardian article overstated the risk of what is known in the jargon as a man-in-the-middle attack, in which a third party could exploit the combination of offline phone, messages in transit and changed key to intercept private communications.The intensity of the external criticism seems to have stemmed partly from frustration that the article was in the Guardian, with its deserved reputation for using and reporting on technology in ways that help bridge the gap between non-experts and specialists.Some were concerned that an overstated claim in the Guardian about risk to the security of WhatsApp would cause non-expert users to become unduly worried and needlessly abandon WhatsApp for less secure communication methods.The critics had two different groups of WhatsApp users in mind.First, the vast majority of users, for whom WhatsApp security is fine and who would probably experience worse communications security if they stopped using it.Second, a much smaller group, activists in authoritarian regimes, whose threat model means they need high security and for whom the popularity of WhatsApp means they can ?blend into the crowd?. This group could be at serious risk if they abandoned WhatsApp for something less secure, or perhaps even for a service more secure but used by relatively few, because that might attract the authorities? attention.A related concern was that authoritarian governments could exploit the Guardian story to move against the use of encrypted messaging.During the review I independently confirmed that a Turkish government official had used the article when, in effect, attempting to deter users from WhatsApp. It was also confirmed that some activists who had been in the process of switching from a less secure messaging service to WhatsApp became confused by the Guardian story. On available evidence, I am unable to conclude whether these effects were widespread. But one case is one too many.I am not an expert in this field. For the review I consulted suitably experienced experts other than the 72 who had already declared their view.I found a consensus that in practice, as WhatsApp is presently understood, it would be very difficult to use this aspect of WhatsApp for systematic targeted surveillance. Experts described challenges with timing, targeting and concealment which they said would be formidable even for a major private or public actor with access to Facebook servers.Experts were unanimous that it is not a backdoor. ?Vulnerability? is a contested term, acceptable in this context to some but not all. One called it a ?weakness?, others a ?trade-off?.One expert called WhatsApp ?pretty excellent security against broad surveillance and that is valuable?. Another said the trade-off was reasonable. A third said: ?This product is safe for the majority of people.?I conveyed to Facebook one specialist?s proposal that the relevant notification setting should be default opt-out, not default opt-in, so that although in-transit messages would continue to be resent automatically, at least senders would be informed that it had happened unless they turned the notification setting off. Facebook replied: ?Yes, WhatsApp considered this but decided against it when considering how it might be interpreted by the average user, who may be using a smartphone for the first time. Instead we chose to make this option available to those wanting an extra layer of security on their accounts.?Experts confirmed that weighing these kinds of considerations about user behaviour is normal when designers are deciding the balance between security and usability in a mass-market service like WhatsApp. The experts confirmed the gist of the responses to the core Guardian article blogged on the day of its publication by two leading figures in developing WhatsApp, Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton.Several independent experts agreed with this part of the open letter?s criticism when it was read to them:?It?s important to recognize the tendency of many security researchers, especially inexperienced ones, to overestimate the practical impact of vulnerabilities they find, and being ignorant how security needs play out in the real world, the massive amount of work on actual user behavior in the face of friction and warnings, and the need for independent verification and context.?I accept the consensus view of the experts and, in consultation with editors, have arranged for the coverage to be amended and for a note to be added drawing attention to the review and linking to this column.I do not agree with critics that the story should be entirely retracted. After all the surrounding controversy, the story?s complete disappearance would be odd. More importantly, there is a clear public interest in the Guardian preserving (with appropriate amendments) reporting on this aspect of WhatsApp and the inherent trade-off. With so many users, watchfulness, news, analysis and debate about the security of WhatsApp are important. Communications privacy is a key element of human rights in the digital era, and developments affecting it ought to be reported. Also, Facebook needs scrutiny, both generally due to its power and specifically in its management of WhatsApp.Facebook?s plan last year to share within its group of companies WhatsApp users? personal information caused controversy and appeared to breach prior commitments. Regulators stepped in, including in the UK. At least one court has upheld a regulator?s intervention.As one expert noted, Facebook?s servers are a black box. It is not possible for outsiders to verify exactly what happens when messages pass through Facebook?s servers on their way to and from WhatsApp users. Trust is required. Given Facebook?s record, steady scrutiny is the right stance.We learned from Edward Snowden?s disclosures that large service providers which handle the communications of millions of people have been compromised in the past. Sections of a research paper published in March 2017 provide a more recent review of encryption workarounds.The UK home secretary, Amber Rudd, has wondered aloud whether service providers should continue to be able lawfully to deny to government authorities access to encrypted messaging. Measures affecting the security of encrypted messaging seem likely to be among new anti-terrorism proposals.I found a consistent view among experts that Facebook could do more to make non-expert users aware of the trade-off and educate them about how to assess their own threat model.Since the Guardian article, WhatsApp has been better secured by the introduction of optional two-factor verification in February. That process was being tested in November 2016 and had been reported in a specialist blog in July 2016, so the Guardian coverage did not prompt the improvement. We will probably never know whether it spurred Facebook to accelerate the process."

"US President Donald Trump personally dictated a misleading statement which his son Donald Trump Jr delivered on his meeting with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential election campaign, according to a Washington Post report. In his statement, Trump Jr said he discussed the adoption of Russian children with the lawyer who had offered damaging information on Hillary Clinton.","summarize: Donald Trump personally dictated the press statement issued in the name of his eldest son Donald Jr that misleadingly downplayed the significance of a 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer, a new report alleged on Monday night.According to the Washington Post, Trump personally intervened to prevent senior White House advisers from issuing a full and truthful account of the meeting on 9 June 2016 in which Donald Trump Jr, the president?s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and then presidential campaign manager Paul Manafort came face-to-face with four Russians. One of the Russian visitors was the well-connected lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.The report, based on multiple though largely anonymous sources that included the president?s own advisers, has the potential to cause political, and even legal, trouble for the White House because it draws Trump himself much closer into the fray over the Trump Tower meeting, which has become a lightning rod in the Russian affair.Shunning the guidance of lawyers and overturning the view apparently reached by Kushner and his team of advisers that a full and frank accounting should be made, Trump reportedly dictated a statement on board Air Force One as he was flying back to Washington from the G20 summit in Germany. As would soon become apparent, it gave a very partial and distorted account of events.In the release the 2016 meeting was presented, in Trump?s own words, as ?a short introductory meeting? dominated by discussion of the adoption of Russian children that was ?not a campaign issue at the time?.That statement was presented to the New York Times on 8 July, and duly included in the newspaper?s first account of the meeting. But within 24 hours, highly damaging revelations had emerged that made clear the meeting had been much more charged than that.On 9 July, the Times revealed that Trump Jr had been lured into talking to Veselnitskaya by the promise of negative intelligence on his father?s presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, and two days after that the email chain was published that showed the younger Trump reveling in the idea of receiving dirt on the Democratic presidential candidate, uttering the gleeful phrase: ?I love it?.The Trump Tower meeting has proved to be one of the most toxic pieces of information to emerge so far in the billowing investigation into possible ties between Trump associates and Russia in the Kremlin?s efforts to skew the presidential outcome in favor of the Republican nominee. The special counsel leading the investigation, Robert Mueller, is understood to be looking closely at the event and has reportedly asked the White House to preserve all documents relating to it.Until now, the president managed to keep some distance from the 9 June encounter, with his lawyers claiming that he knew nothing about it. But the new report that Trump personally oversaw the issuing of a misleading account of the proceedings raises questions about the president?s role in what could be conceived as a cover-up.It comes as Mueller has already expanded his inquiry to include the issue of whether Trump was engaging in a possible obstruction of justice when he fired James Comey, having tried and failed to persuade the then director of the FBI to back off investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn?s contacts with Russian officials.A lawyer for the president issued the Washington Post with a curt statement: ?Apart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent,? Jay Sekulow said.The new details of the president?s role in what turned out to be a major communications fiasco come on the day that his current communications chief, Anthony Scaramucci, was dismissed from the White House after barely 11 days. The blunt removal was made on the first day of the new White House chief of staff, John Kelly, who has vowed to introduce the kind of discipline that the West Wing has been sorely lacking.The day began shortly before 5.30am with Trump tweeting ?No WH chaos!? and ended with him saying: ?A great day at the White House?. But as the Washington Post?s forensic deconstruction of the framing of the Trump Tower meeting shows, the president himself has the capacity to destroy even the best-laid plans, underlining the task now facing his new chief of staff.According to the Post, senior White House officials together with the circle around Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, had spent days rehearsing various ways to address the Trump Tower meeting publicly.Kushner?s team was reported to have decided that it was better to ?err on the side of transparency? because the whole truth would eventually come out.Trump, however, appeared to have seen things differently."
"The Supreme Court slammed the Election Commission on Wednesday after the latter said it cannot take a stand on whether to ban convicted politicians from contesting polls for life. ""Is silence an option for you? You must say either yes or no. How can you be silent? If you are constrained please let us know,"" the bench said.","summarize: In a u-turn the Election Commission said on Wednesday that it cannot take a stand on a demand to bar convicted politicians for life from contesting polls, prompting the Supreme Court to criticise the poll panel for shying away from a crucial issue.?Is silence an option for you? You must say either yes or no. How can you be silent? If you are constrained please let us know,? a bench headed by Justice Ranjan Gogoi asked the EC counsel whose submission was a departure from the stand the commission took in its affidavit.In response to a public interest litigation raising the demand, the EC had on April filed an affidavit where it supported the petitioner?s plea. The short affidavit said the commission supported the cause of the petitioner to decriminalise politics. When the court asked the commission?s lawyer, the latter replied: ?The commission is not taking an adversarial stand. We feel the issue (debarring convicted politicians) is in the legislative domain and we have no stand.??If you feel constrained by the legislature then let us know,? the bench shot back at the counsel. The Centre has already made its stand clear on the issue by opposing the petition. In its affidavit in April it had said that the court should not pass orders on the issue as this is a matter best decided by the Parliament.The court also took a swipe at the petitioner for invoking Article 14 (right to equality) in the case. The petitioner had contended that while a convicted bureaucrat and judicial officer lose his or their jobs, the same principle should apply to convicted politicians.?Are you espousing the cause of public servants, complaining of discrimination on the ground of Article 14,? the bench told the petitioner, fixing July 19 to hear the matter again.Under the Representation of the People Act, a politician convicted and sentenced to a jail term of two years or more shall be disqualified from contesting polls for six years from the date of his release from prison after conclusion of the term.The poll panel had said in its affidavit it was ?alive to the issues that concern the conduct of free and fair elections and functioning of healthy democracy and as such asserting for bringing in electoral reforms which further the cause of free and fair elections.?"
"Bihar's Janata Dal (United) party demanded the resignation of Deputy Chief Minister and Lalu Yadav's son Tejashwi Yadav if his family does not reveal the source of funds used for acquiring allegedly illegal properties. The spat between 'Grand Alliance' members, JD(U) and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), began after raids on the Yadavs' properties, in connection with a land scam. ","summarize: The rift in Bihar?s ruling ?grand alliance? appeared to have widened as the Janata Dal (United) said on Friday that deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav should resign if his family fails to explain the source of funding for properties mired in an alleged scam.The JD(U)?s demand, dismissed by RJD chief Lalu Prasad, followed efforts by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to broker truce among the two allies.Chief minister Nitish Kumar?s JD(U) rules the state with the RJD and Congress, which together defeated the BJP in the 2015 assembly election.But RJD-JD(U) ties were strained after Prasad and his 26-year-old younger son, Tejashwi, were named in a land-for-hotels scandal, and the CBI raided their homes and other properties last week. The alleged scam is from Prasad?s stint as railway minister from 2004 to 2009.The RJD chief, who was in Ranchi attending a fodder scam trial, snapped at a media contingent eager to know of his next move.?Tejashwi was elected by the people, not by those asking for his resignation,? he said. His son had said he won?t step down.Prasad returned to Patna with a court waiver of the hearing on Saturday and met top RJD leaders at his 10 Circular Road home to finalise the next step.Congress president Gandhi spoke to chief minister Kumar to find a middle path to defuse the crisis and dispatched the party?s state chief Ashok Choudhary to play mediator.The JD(U) stuck to its stand and party spokesperson Neeraj Kumar compared assets of the chief minister and Prasad.?Nitish Kumar?s assets are known to the world, but on the other hand, what have you?? he asked Prasad.He said the RJD chief, his wife and former chief minister Rabri Devi, sons Tejashwi and Tej Pratap, and three daughters, including Rajya Sabha parliamentarian Misa Bharati, are charged with benami deals. But the family has not given any ?satisfactory? explanation.?They must come clear and spell out the source of income,? he said. ?The RJD owes it to the people and allies to issue a point by point rebuttal to the CBI charges and come clean on the allegations, or else, Tejashwi must resign.?Read |?Tejashwi Yadav won?t resign, Grand Alliance in Bihar unbreakable, says?Lalu PrasadThe JD(U), however, kept a window open to salvage the alliance as it didn?t specify a time limit for its partner to declare its funding source for the family properties that are under the scanner.?Why should we spell out a deadline?

"The Kangana Ranaut, Shahid Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan starrer 'Rangoon' is ""gorgeous-looking with great cinematography, fantastic sound design and marvellous choreography,"" wrote India Today. ""[O]ddly written characters don't let it become an engaging watch,"" said Hindustan Times. The Times of India wrote that ""some scenes feel tedious"". It has been rated 2/5 (HT) and 3.5/5 (TOI, India Today).","summarize: Rangoon is a triangular love story set in the backdrop of World War II. Here is our Rangoon movie review.Rangoon Cast: Kangana Ranaut, Shahid Kapoor, Saif Ali KhanRangoon Direction: Vishal BhardwajRangoon Rating:  (3.5/5)When Rusi Bilmoria (Saif Ali Khan), an ex-film star who has been just a producer since an on-set accident, finds out that his fiance, the love of his life Miss Julia (Kangana Ranaut), also the top star of his company, has cheated on him with a soldier, Jamadar Nawab Malik (Shahid Kapoor), he turns his head silently towards his woman and looks at her with eyes red with grief, shock and the rage of a thousand suns.If you thought Saif Ali Khan's best moment in the movies till date was the scene in Omkara where he, Langda Tyagi, looks and keeps looking at Ajay Devgn in disbelief when Omkara (Ajay Devgn) makes Kesu (Vivek Oberoi) his political successor; well, stop right there. Saif has outdone his Omkara moment with the aforementioned scene from Rangoon. That alone is worth the price of the ticket.That and the beautiful, almost feral chemistry between the loyal soldier of the British Indian Army, Nawab Malik (Shahid Kapoor), and '40s queen of the Indian big screen Miss Julia (Kangana Ranaut).ALSO SEE: Before Rangoon's Julia, meet the original 'Hunterwali'Rangoon is a triangular love story between Nawab, Julia and Rusi. The story begins in 1943 in India when the British Army requests Rusi Bilmoria to send his beloved, Miss Julia, to the Indo-Burma border so that she can entertain the nation's soldiers. Rusi, a nation-lover, does his duty and sends off Julia with his troupe plus Nawab Malik as Julia's personal security. When the Japanese bomb them on their way, Malik and Julia manage to escape into Burma and, well, love blooms.Vishal Bhardwaj's most expensive and, of late, his most accessible film Rangoon sails smoothly as long its hero and heroine are allowed to just be. Malik and Julia's romance is slow-cooked and the essence of every moment between the two is allowed to linger before the next moment starts. It feels like Nawab Malik and Julia are floating in their own dreamland, perfectly content with the scheme of things, and consequently, Rangoon appears to feel content with itself, devoid of any duties to formal narrative storytelling. There is no rush to fast-forward to the next plot device in this entire stretch where Malik and Julia's romance is built up.Watch Yeh Ishq Hai from Rangoon here:Therefore, in the second half, when Vishal Bhardwaj and Co. pull up their socks to tie all the loose ends and ensure that all three protagonists - Malik, Julia and Rusi - find poetic justice, regardless of how laborious that pursuit might look on screen, Rangoon slowly, slowly bends and breaks its back under the pressure of Vishal Bhardwaj's narrative ambitions.ALSO SEE: Will Rangoon prove to be another Queen for Kangana Ranaut?Rangoon is gorgeous-looking with great cinematography (Pankaj Kumar, take a bow), fantastic sound design and marvellous choreography (Farah Khan, Sudesh Adhana). Love-making in the mud has never looked (and probably, never will) this sexy in a mainstream Hindi film. All that is fine. Where Rangoon does a bloody fail is its attempt to see through its two parallel narrative strands finding a common end: one, the love story, and the other, the war-conspiracy backdrop with the British Indian Army and Subhas Chandra Bose's INA mixed up.Vishal Bhardwaj, caught with the duty to serve two movies in one (an old-school romance and a war thriller), doesn't really do a Casablanca though he does give Rangoon his best shot. Nevertheless, Rangoon comes off as probably 2017's most good-looking and well-made Indian film. Certainly, this year's most ambitious, with three great lead performances. Vishal Bhardwaj is in fine form, mostly. And yes, the National Anthem comes thrice in the film.

The increase in the basic itself would take his gross pay to nearly Rs 3.70 lakh.Patel, who took over the reins of the central bank in September 2016, had received a salary of Rs 2.09 lakh in October -- the first full month in office. This amount was same as drawn by his predecessor Raghuram Rajan in August that year.Rajan assumed RBI governorship from September 5, 2013 at a monthly salary of Rs 1.69 lakh.

"Indian tennis player Sania Mirza's former women's doubles partner Switzerland's Martina Hingis won the Wimbledon mixed doubles title alongside Andy Murray's brother Jamie Murray on Sunday. The British-Swiss duo defeated defending champions Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen. This was Murray's fourth Grand Slam title, while Hingis registered her 23rd Grand Slam title triumph.","summarize: Jamie Murray ensured the family name will be on a Wimbledon trophy for the third time in five years as he and the former world No1 Martina Hingis beat the defending champions Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen of Finland 6-4, 6-4 to win the mixed doubles crown.After the painful end to Andy Murray?s title defence, it was left to Jamie to produce the goods and he and Hingis, the No1 seeds, duly clinched victory in 74 minutes.?I have to thank Martina for asking me as I wasn?t going to play mixed doubles,? Murray said. ?When she texted me, it was an easy decision to play, she?s such a great player. Anyone in the locker room would have jumped at the chance to play with her. I really enjoyed the whole week. It?s a great achievement. Any time you win a grand slam, get your name up on the board again, it?s there forever. No one will take it away from you.?Andy Murray, notoriously nervous when watching his brother play, was lurking in the locker room during the match but was there to congratulate him soon after he came off court. ?I just saw him there,? Jamie said. ?He said he came in the middle of the first set. I think he just waited in the lockers. He said he didn?t watch it. I don?t know if he snuck a few points in or not.?With Murray and Watson on opposite sides of the net, it was a win-win situation for British fans on Centre Court, most of whom had stuck around after seeing Roger Federer clinch a record eighth singles title earlier in the day. And they were rewarded with a match full of power, angles, deft volleys and outstanding movement around the net, especially from Murray, whose net skills left the crowd gasping at times.Hingis was the runner-up to Kontinen and Watson last year alongside Leander Paes but when she dumped the Indian in favour of Murray, the Scot knew he had a great chance to add to his grand slam tally. Ten years after partnering Jelena Jankovic to victory here, this was his fourth grand slam crown in all while Hingis took her total to 23, five singles, 12 women?s doubles and six mixed, five of which have come since the beginning of 2015.The big-hitting Kontinen, the men?s doubles world No1, had his moments and Watson held her own but last year?s champions were always up against it with Hingis?s dipping returns perfectly complementing Murray?s sharp net play. After trading early breaks, Watson was broken for the second time at 3-3 and they closed out the opening set.Kontinen and Watson had two chances to break the Murray serve at 3-2 up in the second set but could not take them. A slightly mis-hit return from Hingis set up two break points for the top seeds on the Watson serve at 3-3 and they took the second to get the vital break as Watson hit a forehand into the net. After Hingis held to love, the pair saved three break points to serve out for the title.Kontinen said he and Watson had not taken their chances but they hope to team up again next year. Murray and Hingis have yet to discuss future plans but it seems likely they will defend their title next summer and they may even play together in the US Open later this summer.Hingis, who won the singles here 20 years ago, admitted she was ?not used to no? when she asks someone to play mixed doubles. ?Here, it?s always tough,? she said. ?I understand in the past guys would have said no because they really want to focus on doubles only because it?s three?out-of-five [sets]. This is the only tournament that still does it. It?s definitely easier to ask somebody at the other three grand slams and not Wimbledon. But I was definitely hoping for a yes.?As Jamie said: ?It was a good decision by both of us.?"

"US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that the Islamic State was ""on the run"" and will soon be ""wiped out"" of Syria and Iraq.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2017Commander of US forces in Iraq Lt Gen Stephen Townsend told Pentagon reporters that the IS has lost its capital in Iraq and the largest population centre they held anywhere in the world.?Iraqi militia forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, and the global coalition also deserve a share of the credit for their sacrifices to achieve this hard-won victory,? he said.?Make no mistake, this victory alone does not eliminate ISIS, and there?s still tough fighting ahead. There are still pockets of resistance in Mosul, hold-outs, and hidden IEDs that will take weeks to clear, as well as remaining ISIS enclaves in Hawija and western Anbar,? Townsend said.There are also humanitarian and stabilisation efforts desperately needed to ease the suffering of Mosul citizens and start the city on the road to recovery, he said.Though the Moslawis have suffered greatly, the east side is already springing back to life less than six months after its liberation. And Moslawis have already started to return to their neighbourhoods in the west.?But still, the loss of one of the twin capitals and a jewel of their so-called caliphate is a decisive blow to ISIS and certainly something for the Iraqis to celebrate. They can also celebrate the remarkable turnaround their security forces have made in the course of the past three years,? Townsend said.However, he said that there was still no news about the IS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.?There?s been a lot of media interest in the whereabouts and status of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Despite all the helpful reports to us from every source imaginable, I?m unable to confirm or deny where he is or whether he is alive or dead. Let me just say for the record, my fervent hope is it is the latter,? he said.IS is an evil enemy who will resort to any lengths to maintain their hold on the territory they claim as their caliphate, Townsend said.?But make no mistake, it is a losing cause. Our partners in the international coalition against ISIS will stand side by side against ISIS until they?re defeated in both Iraq and Syria,? Townsend asserted.  "

"An increasing number of women in Iran have been refusing to wear hijab while driving, sparking a nationwide debate about whether a car is a private space. Notably, Iranian women are obliged to wear hijabs in public. However, President Hassan Rouhani has argued that people's private space should be respected, opposing a crackdown on women who do not wear hijab.","summarize: A growing number of women in Iran are refusing to wear a hijab while driving, sparking a nationwide debate about whether a car is a private space where they can dress more freely.Obligatory wearing of the hijab has been an integral policy of the Islamic republic since the 1979 revolution but it is one the establishment has had a great deal of difficulty enforcing. Many Iranian women are already pushing the boundaries, and observers in Tehran say women who drive with their headscarves resting on their shoulders are becoming a familiar sight.Clashes between women and Iran?s morality police particularly increase in the summer when temperatures rise. But even though the police regularly stop these drivers, fining them or even temporarily seizing their vehicle, such acts of resistance have continued, infuriating hardliners over a long-standing policy they have had a great deal of difficulty enforcing. Iran?s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, has argued that people?s private space should be respected and opposes a crackdown on women who don?t wear the hijab. He said explicitly that the police?s job is not to administer Islam. Speaking in 2015, Rouhani said: ?The police can?t do something and say I?m doing this because God said so. That?s not a police [officer]?s business.?Many in Iran believe that private space includes the inside of a car, but judicial authorities and the police have opposed that interpretation. ?The invisible part of the car, such as the trunk, is a private space, but this does not apply to the visible parts of the car,? Hadi Sadeghi, the deputy head of Iran?s judiciary chief, said last week. His comments have prompted widespread reaction online, with one user posting a satirical picture showing a couple embracing in a car boot. Another user tweeted: ?The police have said that only the boot is a private space... poor those of us who have a hatchback car [without a boot]... we don?t have any private space.? Local media often refrain from directly criticising the mandatory hijab, but the debate over what constitutes a private space has allowed newspapers and even state news agencies to publish articles reflecting views from both sides. ?Private or not private?? asked an article carried by the state Irna news agency on Monday. ?This is a question that has created a legal and religious discussion about private space within cars.? Hossein Ahmadiniaz, a lawyer, told Irna that infringing on people?s private spaces was like infringing their citizen?s rights, arguing that it was up to parliamentarians to define the private space and not the police. ?The law says that the space within a car is a private space,? he said. ?The government?s citizen?s rights charter [launched by Rouhani] also considers a car to be a private space and it is incumbent upon enforcers to respect that.?Bahman Keshavarz, a leading lawyer, wrote an article in the reformist Shargh daily, arguing that wearing a so-called ?bad hijab? (loose hijab) is not a crime under Iranian law. Saeid Montazeralmahdi, a spokesperson for the Iranian police, disagreed. ?What is visible to the public eye is not private space and norms and the rules should be respected within cars.? He also warned car owners against using tinted glass to prevent onlookers from seeing into the car. The debate is not only among liberal Iranians. Abolfazl Najafi Tehrani, a cleric based in Tehran, tweeted: ?People?s cars, like people?s houses, are their property and a private space and infringing upon this space will disturb people?s moral security and will harm women?s trust with the police.?Yahya Kamalpour, a member of the Iranian parliament, said: ?The space within people?s cars is a private space and the police has no right to enter that space without a judicial order.?The debate comes amid a growing rift between the government and the hardline judiciary that acts independently of Rouhani?s government. Despite restrictions, women are increasingly active in Iranian society. It emerged on Sunday that Iran Air, the country?s national airline, has for the first time appointed a female CEO. Rouhani is also under pressure from his voter base to nominate a record number of female ministers in his cabinet reshuffle next month. In a sign of slowly changing attitudes, Ali Karimi, a veteran Iranian footballer, on Monday called on the authorities to allow female fans to attend stadiums alongside men. "

"The Islamic State has lost its hold in Afghanistan following the death of its leader Abu Sayed in a US strike, according to the US Department of Defense. Adding that the leader's death has disrupted the terror group's plans to expand its operations in Afghanistan, the Pentagon estimated that the militants do not number more than 1,000.","summarize: By Lalit K Jha Washington, Jul 18 (PTI) The Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K) has lost its hold in Afghanistan, days after the terror groups head Abu Sayed, was killed by US troops in an airstrike, the Pentagon has said. The Pentagon now estimates that ISIS-K in Afghanistan numbers somewhere in the hundreds. ""We dont think its over 1,000. They hold no meaningful territory in Nangarhar province. There are certainly fighters there but theyre mostly spending their time trying to stay alive,"" said Pentagon Spokesman Navy Capt Jeff Davis. During an off-camera news conference yesterday, Davis said the killing of ISIS-K leader Abu Sayed in a drone strike last week disrupted it?s expansion plans. ""His death will further disrupt the groups plans to expand its operations in Afghanistan,"" he said, adding that this is the third time in the past year that US forces in Afghanistan have killed a sitting leader of ISIS-K. ""Killed in a kinetic strike on July 11 in Kunar, Abu Syed was the overall ISIS-K Amir in Afghanistan for only six weeks, issuing operational guidance, financial management and acting as the primary decision-maker for operations with ISIS- throughout Afghanistan,"" he said. ""His death comes not long after that of his predecessor, Sheikh Abdul Hasib, who was killed by US forces in a raid on April 26 in Achin, Nangarhar province as part of ongoing efforts to defeat ISIS-K in Afghanistan,"" he added. ""ISIS threatens America and the west because of its commitment to plot, direct and inspire terrorist attacks and its ability to recruit, move and finance the terrorists who commit these attacks,"" he said, adding that the terrorists have been very clear in their propaganda magazine and other publications, that they want to recruit and attack globally. ""ISIS-K called was formed in January 2015 as a despondent group of several Islamic extremist organizations, loosely organized and committed to supporting the radical ideals of the Islamic State,"" Davis said, adding that ISIS-K is committed to establishing an Afghan presence on behalf of ISIS and furthering ISIS Caliphate to the abolition of traditionally recognised sovereign borders.

"Singer Shreya Ghoshal has said that people often underestimate the audience of our country as well as worldwide, by thinking that they don't understand art.

I am not holding on to any thought if I should take up a project or not. Sometimes, I make sure that I don?t think about whether a song will do well or not,? she adds.After singing countless tracks in films as a playback singer, Shreya has launched her first independent track Dhadkane Azad Hai. She feels this was the right time for her to take a step towards solo tracks.?It came from my heart that I should go independent from films. Undoubtedly, there?s a lot of scope for good music in films but sometimes, we are confined in that boundary to sing within the story narrative and because it is a film, there are a lot of constraints. I wanted to sing something, which was out of those restrictions,? she says.Follow @htshowbiz for more"

"A tree dubbed the 'neem-beer-tree', located in Delhi University's North Campus, has reportedly been secreting an intoxicating white liquid since November 2016. It reportedly releases 10 litres of the liquid every day, which smells like toddy, the alcoholic sap obtained from palm trees. ""I had two to three glasses of the toddy. It was quite intoxicating,"" stated a labourer.","summarize: There is an open bar in the Delhi University, and it?s absolutely free!Poor tipplers in North Campus have been using ?neem beer? from a local tree for the past four months to stay high and hydrated. Several people, mostly labourers working in the university, queue up with containers near the freak neem tree for their daily fix. They like it better than off-the-shelf liquor; moreover, it comes free.?A neem tree has been secreting a white liquid since November 2016. It smells of toddy (naturally alcoholic sap of palm) and tastes somewhat bitter. But people from the campus and outside collect it to drink. They say it is intoxicating,? said Mahesh Prasad, the head gardener of North Campus.There are around 15 neem trees near the rugby stadium towards the back end of the campus, most of which are more than 50 years old. But only one tree is giving out the sap ? at least 10 litres a day.?This is unusual. It is for the first time that we have witnessed anything of this sort in Delhi,? said CR Babu, professor emeritus at Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE) in Delhi University.Like any watering hole, it?s easy to locate the inebriating tree. The strong beer-like scent can be smelled at least 10 feet, or even more, from the tree. The charade of bottles, buckets and pitchers is also a good enough sign.?I had two to three glasses of the toddy. It was quite intoxicating. I didn?t fall ill after that. As it is a neem tree, I think, it also has some medicinal properties,? said a labourer, in high spirits.Someone has also placed a ladder and tied a bucket right at the source. Not a drop to be wasted.?The liquid was coming out from near a joint of two branches. But then, it stopped and started to come out from a different place. The flow is gradually slowing down. The smell is also becoming weaker,? said Vikrant Goswami, a scientific assistant at CEMDE.Scientists from the university?s department of environmental studies are testing ? in the laboratory ? samples of the liquid.?We suspect it is not the kind of toddy which we usually get from palm trees. There is some kind of microbial activity going on inside the tree. The microbe is helping the tree sap to ferment,? said Dr David Kothamasi, assistant professor at the department.It would take at least a month for the test results to be available. In the lab, too, the bottle in which the toddy has been capped started to inflate when its cap was sealed. That?s a signal that the fermentation process has not stopped. Scientists said a similar incident was reported in Varanasi a few years ago. Tests revealed the presence of salicyclic acid, a key ingredient in aspirin.The evergreen neem is the magic tree of Ayurvedic medicine, and is called sarva roga nivarini or the one that prevents and cures all diseases.

He was admitted into this school only on Friday last and he returned home on Saturday. He was forcibly brought back to school on Monday evening. May be he felt home sick,?

"The British government must hold a vote in both houses of the Parliament before starting the process of leaving the European Union, the country's Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday. UK Prime Minister Theresa May had earlier promised lawmakers a vote on the outcome of the Brexit talks, but had hoped to trigger the talks without parliamentary approval.","summarize: The government has lost its fast-tracked appeal to the supreme court, forcing ministers to introduce emergency legislation into parliament to authorise the UK?s departure from the EU.In a judgment that sets a far-reaching constitutional precedent and upholds parliamentary sovereignty, the court ruled by a majority of eight justices to three that MPs and peers must give their consent before the government can trigger article 50 and formally initiate Brexit.The decision sets clear limits on the extent of the government?s executive powers. Rights embedded in the law by the 1972 European Communities Act, which took the UK into what was then the European Community, cannot be removed by the government?s prerogative powers, a majority of the justices declared.The eagerly awaited ruling by the largest panel of judges ever assembled in Britain?s highest court routes the protracted Brexit process through parliament, handing over to MPs and peers the authority to sanction the UK?s withdrawal.The supreme court ruled that there was no need for the government to wait for consent from the devolved assemblies in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Although the ruling represents a blow to Theresa May?s intended timetable on Brexit, a Downing Street spokesman said the ruling had not changed the verdict of the British people. ?It?s important to remember that parliament backed the referendum by a margin of six to one and has already indicated its support for getting on with the process of exit to the timetable we have set out,? a spokesman said. ?We respect the supreme court?s decision, and will set out our next steps to parliament shortly.?The government now has a tight deadline to pass even a short bill through parliament, but it is still possible to meet its article 50 deadline of the end of March. In May?s favour, there is not a large appetite in either the Commons or the Lords to actively block the process. The SNP and Lib Dems are likely to vote against the bill if their amendments are not passed, and some Labour rebels will join them. But Labour has no desire to appear to be trying to prevent the referendum result being honoured. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said his party would not ?frustrate the process for invoking article 50? but would seek to amend the government?s bill. Corbyn said: ?Labour will seek to amend the article 50 bill to prevent the Conservatives using Brexit to turn Britain into a bargain basement tax haven off the coast of Europe. ?Labour will seek to build in the principles of full, tariff-free access to the single market and maintenance of workers? rights and social and environmental protections. ?Labour is demanding a plan from the government to ensure it is accountable to parliament throughout the negotiations and a meaningful vote to ensure the final deal is given parliamentary approval.?The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, confirmed his party would vote against article 50 unless people were given another vote on the final deal.Scotland?s first minister Nicola Sturgeon, said the ruling showed the promises made to the Scottish government on devolution were ?not worth the paper they were written on?. She said the Scottish parliament would still have an opportunity to vote on whether it consented to the triggering of article 50.The attorney general, Jeremy Wright, said the government was ?disappointed? by the supreme court ruling but would comply with it. He said enacting the decision would now be a political and not legal matter and the Brexit secretary, David Davis, would be making a statement to the Commons later on Tuesday.Gina Miller, the investment fund manager who was one of the lead claimants in the challenge, welcomed the ruling, saying: ?No prime minister, no government can expect to be unanswerable or unchallenged. Parliament alone is sovereign.? Outside the court, she said MPs would now have the chance to help the government select the best course in Brexit talks. She also spoke of how this ?divisive issue of a generation? had led to her and her legal team facing ?extraordinary and unwarranted criticism?. The justice secretary, Liz Truss, who faced criticism for not defending the appeal court justices denounced by sections of the media as ?enemies of the people? after they ruled against the government, said: ?Our independent judiciary is the cornerstone of the rule of law and is vital to our constitution and our freedoms. The reputation of our judiciary is unrivalled the world over, and our supreme court justices are people of integrity and impartiality. ?While we may not always agree with judgments, it is a fundamental part of any thriving democracy that legal process is followed. The government has been clear that it will respect the decision of the court.? The president of the supreme court, Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury, delivered a summary of the decision, which has far-reaching constitutional implications.Reading the summary, Neuberger said: ?By a majority of eight to three, the supreme court rules that the government cannot trigger article 50 without an act of parliament authorising it to do so.?Section 2 of the 1972 [European Communities] Act provides that, whenever EU institutions make new laws, those new laws become part of UK law. The 1972 act therefore makes EU law an independent source of UK law, until parliament decides otherwise.?Therefore, when the UK withdraws from the EU treaties, a source of UK law will be cut off. Further, certain rights enjoyed by UK citizens will be changed. Therefore, the government cannot trigger article 50 without parliament authorising that course.?Neuberger said: ?Any change in the law to give effect to the referendum must be made in the only way permitted by the UK constitution, namely by an act of parliament. To proceed otherwise would be a breach of settled constitutional principles stretching back many centuries.?The eight to three margin of defeat suffered by the government was bigger than ministers had hoped for. They had already conceded in advance that they would probably lose.The three dissenting justices who found for the government were Lords Reed, Carnwath and Hughes. Their judgments say that the European Communities Act did not restrict the government?s use of its prerogative powers and that ministers could withdraw without reference to parliament. The devolved assemblies in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff had argued for a say on the basis of the Sewel convention, which provides for them to be consulted on matters that are ?normally? devolved, but they did not win any formal right to participate in the Brexit process.Neuberger said: ?On the devolution issues, the court unanimously rules that UK ministers are not legally compelled to consult the devolved legislatures before triggering article 50. The devolution statutes were enacted on the assumption that the UK would be a member of the EU, but they do not require it. Relations with the EU are a matter for the UK government.?The Sewel convention plays an important role in the operation of the UK constitution but the policing of its scope and operation is not a matter for the courts.?Paragraph 122 of the 96-page long judgment makes clear that it is up to MPs and peers to decide what form the bill put before parliament should take. The majority judgment states: ?What form such legislation should take is entirely a matter for parliament. But, in the light of a point made in oral argument, it is right to add that the fact that parliament may decide to content itself with a very brief statute is nothing to the point. There is no equivalence between the constitutional importance of a statute, or any other document, and its length or complexity. ?A notice under article 50(2) could no doubt be very short indeed, but that would not undermine its momentous significance.?"

The minister also said violation of the pact can result in calling off the negotiations, cancellation of contracts, encashment of bank guarantees and debarment from future procurement. PTI RAM ARC "

The affected districts of western UP include Agra, Oraiyya, Badaun, Bulandshehar, Etawah, Firozabad, Ghaziabad, Noida, Jhansi, Hamirpur, Jalaun, Jyotiba Phule Nagar, Hathras, Mahoba, Mathura, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Rampur, Pilibhit, Saharanpur, and Etah.Agra's neighboring district Mainpuri has had 307.99 mm rains in July, Etah has had 274.3 mm, Firozabad has had 244.4 mm, while Mathura has had only 164.3 mm rainfall. A Meteorological Department official told India Today that the drought affected 5 districts have had seriously low rainfall this July.Agra has had 53 per cent lower rainfall this year, with just 123.5 mm rainfall. The average for July is 260.4 mm. Rampur lost 52 per cent of its annual rainfall and got only 191.3 mm rains compared to the average of 399.4 mm. Noida got just 96 mm rains against an average of 204.2 mm, making a shortfall of 53 per cent. Ghaziabad had 105.8 mm rains against 238.6 mm average, with a shortfall of 56 per cent. Muzaffar Nagar lost 61% of its water, getting only 120.4 mm rains compared to 305.2 mm average. Similarly, Pilibhit too lost 62 per cent water this month, getting 152.8 mm rains against 403 mm average.Commenting on the lack of rains in Agra, social activist Vishal Sharma quoted a small verse ""Shukr hai Agra mein nahin baraste badal, mere sheher ko barish ki aadat nahin hai"". He said that although the dry season brings its own set of problems, it is a fact that Agra is not equipped to handle rains that last even an hour, let alone an entire day. The civic amenities in the city are prone to failure in the event of heavy rains due to the lack of drainage in most of the city, as was witnessed a couple of years earlier when heavy rainfall caused vast property damage in the city and the municipal authorities struggled for days to clear the water-logging in the low-lying areas.Sharma said that even this month, the rainfall that took place a couple of days back, claimed the roofs of several old houses in Motikatra, Nagla Joshiyan and other parts of the old city, injuring a number of people. Several houses were also cracked, although the rain was not enough to cause serious water logging. However, even 40-50 mm rainfall in a day would be enough to cut off most of the densely populated outer areas from the rest of the city for several hours, if not days.Meanwhile, Agra District Magistrate Gaurav Dayal has instructed all Sub-Divisional Magistrates and Additional District Magistrates of Agra to prepare reports of the drought so that the compensation amounts could be decided for the farmers.ALSO READ:"

Amrapali received a final recovery notice in March 2017 but when it failed to pay, police took action. The district administration said labour cess is charged for labour's welfare, which the group didn't pay.","summarize: The director and chief executive officer (healthcare) of Amrapali Group were arrested by tehsildar of Dadri on Monday afternoon from their corporate office in Sector 62 for not paying labour cess amounting to Rs 4.29 crore to the labour department.

Tehsildar Dadri PL Maurya said the duo was served several notices by deputy labour commissioner of Gautam Budh Nagar to pay labour cess, which is meant for the welfare of labourers, but the group did not pay any heed. ?The labour department issued a recovery certificate for the recovery of the amount and I conducted searches at the office of the Amrapali Group along with the police,?

"A 35-year-old woman was allegedly kidnapped and gangraped by three men in a moving car for three hours on Monday night, the police said. The woman was kidnapped in Sohna, Gurugram, where the accused repeatedly raped her before driving to Greater Noida and throwing her out of the car. She was found near a hospital, while the accused are absconding.","summarize: A 35-year-old woman was gangraped on Monday in Sohna, Haryana in a horrific ordeal that is believed to have lasted several hours. According to the woman, three men in a Maruti Swift car kidnapped her and drove her around on the streets of Sohna for several hours while repeatedly raped her. She was then driven all the way to Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh where she was thrown out of the car near Yatharh Hospital in Kasna. Based on the girl's written statement, Noida police have filed a First Information Report under Indian Penal Code Section 376D, which deals with gangrape. WHAT HAPPENED? According to the woman's statement, she was abducted by three men in a Swift car from near her home in Sohna, Gurgaon at 8.45 pm on Monday. The men then drove her around for four to five hours, taking turns to repeatedly molest and rape her. With the woman still in the car, the men then drove all the way to Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh where they flung her out of the car near the Yatharth Hospital in Kasna around 4 am. She recounted her horrific ordeal with locals in the area who then called the Noida police. Noida police reached the spot, informed their counterparts in Gurgaon and took the woman for a medical examination at Yatharth Hospital. Senior Superintendent of Police, Gautam Budh Nagar, Love Kumar told India Today that the woman was then taken back to Sohna to identify the spot from where she was abducted. Kumar also told India Today that there were certain discrepancies in the woman's initial statements and the police was working to verify and corroborate her claims. It remains unclear what route the alleged rapists took while driving from Sohna to Greater Noida. Kumar said the police is working to establish how the woman was brought to Greater Noida. The woman hails from Rajasthan's Bharatpur city and came to Sohna around 10-15 days ago and was staying with her family.DRUNK MEN?Meanwhile, initial investigation into the incident has indicated that the men were drunk or were drinking while the alleged gangrape occurred. Some beer bottles were also found from the spot which indicates that the accused persons were inebriated at the time,"" a senior Greater Noida police officer told news agency PTI.The men are also believed to have threatened the woman with dire consequences if she approached the police.

Police teams are examining CCTV footage to identify the route the Swift car took to travel the around 80-kilometer distance from Sohna to Greater Noida. The FIR has been registered by Noida police's Kasna unit and Gurgaon police has said they will be assisting the Noida cops. ""We have taken the details from SSP Gautam Budh Nagar, Love Kumar. A team of the Gautambudh Nagar police is arriving in Gurgaon to examine the sequence of the crime. We are examining whether they lodged a zero FIR in this regard.

The UP government will help the Haryana Police with whatever help they need to probe the incident, Singh said. COPS FOUND SLEEPING - UNRELATED INCIDENTWhile questions remain over how the alleged rapists were able to travel all the way from Gurgaon to Greater Noida without being stopped by cops, in an unrelated development, two Noida policemen stationed at a Police Control Room van were shunted out after they were found sleeping during the night.The Swift car in which the alleged gangrape occurred is not believed to have passed through the area in which PCR van was stationed. However, an unidentified person, who reportedly shot a video of the sleeping cops, sent the footage to Gautam Budh Nagar SSP Love Kumar after news of Monday's alleged gangrape came to light. Acting on the information, SSP Kumar transferred the policemen for dereliction of duty.ANOTHER GURGAON HORRORMonday night's incident comes a day after a seven-year-old girl was raped, allegedly by a 20-year-old auto driver in Gurgaon. The minor girl was alone in her home on Sunday when the incident took place.

It made Simians ? apes, chimps, monkeys of all sorts ? evolve quicker than they were meant to. Soon, like most oppressed beings suddenly empowered, they fought back. They were led in that first battle by an ape named Caesar, who had seen the compassion mankind was capable of, but also the cruelty.It?s been fifteen years since the fight on the Golden Gate Bridge, a fight the apes won, but after which they were forced to leave the dangerous cities. Caesar, battle-worn and scarred, has taken his apes, and his family, into the woods, where they lay in hiding, one eye always glancing over their shoulder for the last remnants of humanity to attack.Word has travelled over the snowy mountains that a violent militia has been formed by a cruel man, a man who calls himself The Colonel, like Apocalypse Now?s Kurtz, utterly consumed by insanity. He has imprisoned hundreds of apes at his large compound, which lies at the foot of snowy, forested mountains. He makes them work, under his boot-heels, tamed to the sound of his whip. He has madness in his eyes, they say. A torn, tattered American flag hangs limply off his balcony, from where, like Schindler?s List?s Amon Göth, he surveys his kingdom through a lens.He wants them to build a wall.War for the Planet of the Apes is the rare blockbuster that arrives once, maybe twice every year. In 2017, we haven?t seen a better one since Logan, a film with which it shares several similarities ? a hero driven by duty, a mute young girl whom he must protect, and a sombre tone that will surely test the patience of some audience members. But that?s what made me like it more.With this, Matt Reeves has made his fourth, unquestionably great movie. His grip on the war movie tone, aided by stunning, almost biblically grand visuals and music by two Michaels, Seresin and Giacchino, firmly establish him as one of the finest directors working within the studio system today. It might even be the first great post-human movie ? for more reasons than one. Technically, because it signals the arrival of an era in cinema where human actors could quite possibly be made obsolete, and thematically, because it suggests that human beings are a scourge that needs to be destroyed.Over the three films that span several decades, the Planet of the Apes reboot series tells an epic story of one creature?s rise, but it is also a Shakespearean tragedy ? a cautionary tale that chronicles the slow death of an entire species: Mankind.Our hubris, it suggests, is the reason behind our downfall. We have been led to believe, ever since we were little children, ignorant and malleable, that we are the apex predators, that we occupy the throne at the top of the food chain. This is a lie. We are simply at that stage in the evolution of our planet at which we happen to be the most intelligent life forms living on it. Faced with the prospect of billions of more years? worth of evolution, we could easily be overtaken by an even more intelligent species ? perhaps one of our own making.Like Bong Joon-ho?s terrific Okja, a film that could very easily be its close cousin, War for the Planet of the Apes harbours an unshakable contempt for humanity. And along with its immediate predecessor, the quietly brilliant Dawn for the Planet of the Apes, it firmly believes that we are beyond redemption, and that the only thing to do is for us to gracefully die out.But what are we without our fighting spirit? What are we without our silly delusions and false confidence? It?s what makes us human, dammit! So foolishly, we fight, even in the face of inevitable defeat, without realising ? and this is crucial ? that more often than not, we are the villains. In this particular situation, that face of inevitable defeat looks like an angry ape?s.And what an intricate work of art it is. Crafted by hundreds of immensely talented people, sculpted around a flawless central performance by Andy Serkis, a maverick and a maven. If this doesn?t get him an Academy Award nomination, then we must rally the troops, and like a bunch of apes, protest till they start firing arrows at our sides, yelling ?Apes, together, strong,? till we die.Watch the War for the Planet of the Apes trailer hereFollow @htshowbiz for moreThe author tweets @RohanNaahar"

"Actor Jackie Shroff, while responding to filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma's tweet on Women's Day regarding actress Sunny Leone, said that Varma is a big boy and the tweet reflects his thinking. He added, ""He knows what he's talking about...But I will not say such a thing about a lady."" Varma had apologised after being called sexist for his tweet.","summarize: After Ram Gopal Varma took on Tiger Shroff and urged women to pleasure men the way Sunny Leone does, bindaas Bhidu Jackie Shroff spoke his mind on the endless controversies his Sarkar 3 (and Rangeela) director RGV has recently drowned himself in.It all began when RGV in a tweet advised Tiger Shroff to not being a 'bikini babe' and instead learn some 'machoism' from his dad Jackie.This happened on March 2, the day Tiger celebrated his birthday. When criticised for his tweets, Ramu said that his tweets were meant to be appreciative of Jackie and that his wife (and Tiger's mom) Ayesha shouldn't be taking his tweets to heart.Recently, at an event, when Jackie Shroff was asked to comment on Ramu's rather harsh words about his son, the veteran actor said, ""He spoke about my son but that doesn't mean I will go and fight with him.""I wish all the women in the world give men as much happiness as Sunny Leone givesFair enough. Jackie also had an interesting opinion on RGV's Women's Day tweet. Calling Ram Gopal Varma a 'big boy', Jackie said, ""He is a big boy. He knows what he is talking about... But I will not say such a thing about a lady. It's his thinking.""While Ramu's tweets were being seen as vile, disgusting and sexist, Tiger Shroff took RGV's criticism on a positive note. He was quoted as saying, ""I am not even half the man that my father is. He is the original hero. Even if I tried, I can't be like him. But everyone has the freedom of speech. He is a senior director, so, there's not much I can say to him."""

A 27-year-old Irfan was arrested by Delhi Police from his hometown in Bihar's Pupri district for involvement in 12 burglary cases. He allegedly stole expensive and luxury items from homes in southeast Delhi and organised health camps for the poor in his native village. Irfan had reportedly come to Delhi four years ago in search of a job. ,"summarize: In Delhi?s posh neighbourhoods, 27-year-old Irfan was a nameless and faceless burglar who broke into homes and made away with jewellery and other valuables. But, in his native village in Bihar?s Sitamarhi district, Irfan portrayed himself as a social worker who organised health camps and funded the weddings for poor families -- all to fuel his political ambitions.The police were on his trail ever since May this year when he allegedly stole gold and diamond jewellery worth lakhs of rupees from a house in New Friends Colony. He was, however, caught on a CCTV?camera and it did not take the investigators too long to identify him.Once his address was known, police raided his native village and nabbed him on July 6. When the police caught him, he was wearing a Rolex watch that was allegedly stolen from a house in Delhi. He had also recently bought a Honda Civic sedan after selling some stolen items.Within no time, his link to a dozen similar burglaries in the posh localities of south Delhi was revealed. Irfan lived in a rented house in Jamia Nagar.Police officers said Irfan alias Ujala was trying to earn the image of a ?Robin Hood? in his village to achieve a larger objective. ?Irfan harboured political ambitions. He was consciously creating that image to fuel his dreams,? said an investigator.When the police team traced him to his village earlier this month, residents of his village refused to accept that Irfan was a thief who would frequently steal from the rich residents of south Delhi. ?Villagers insisted that Irfan was a Delhi-based businessman who did social work in his village. They respectfully addressed him as Ujala Babu,? an investigator told Hindustan Times. Police said Irfan not only presented a ?larger than life? image in front of the villagers, he had also been lying to his girlfriend -- a woman who had apparently acted in a few Bhojpuri films.The police team had to convince the villagers by showing them CCTV footage of Irfan?s alleged involvement in thefts in New Friends Colony and Lajpat Nagar. A search of his property led to the seizure of stolen jewellery, watches and other valuables worth over Rs 20 lakh.Irfan was arrested from Bihar?s Pupri district July 6.

						While the police team too was initially taken aback by Irfan?s reputation, a further investigation into his life revealed that he harboured a dream to make it big in local politics and all his ?social work? was a conscious effort to realise his dream.?He would don kurta-pyjama and frequently upload pictures of his social work on Facebook. He was very conscious of his image and used to participate in the smallest of social activities in his village. He even used to discuss a foray into politics with the people he helped,? said the investigator.The larger portion of his loot, however, would fund his frequent pub visits, expensive cars, costly watches and clothes. ?He once offered to give Rs 10,000 at a bar in Delhi if the live performers there sang a song of his choice,? said Romil Baaniya, DCP (south-east).Irfan has told his interrogators that he would never wear shoes or slippers while committing the burglaries that mostly involved breaking into houses through doors or windows of houses locked from outside. ?He believed that if he would walk barefoot, he would be able to steal without alerting anyone,? said an officer.(This story has been updated with details)Read: He sold momos, dreamt of Audi: How Delhi murder suspect took shortcut to luxury"

"The Delhi Police will reportedly get around 30 sniffer and explosive-detection dogs in a month from the Indian Army Veterinary Corps. The dogs will help police deal with security challenges in the Capital, reports said. Delhi hosts several high-profile events which attract anti-national elements and so security of these venues is a top priority, a police official said. ","summarize: The police department is set to get a pack of canny canines from the Army to scent any trouble in the city.Delhi Police is expecting about 30 sniffer and explosive-detection dogs in a month from the Indian Army Veterinary Corps (IAVC).The four-legged recruits will help the department deal with security challenges in the Capital that frequently receives threats from terrorist groups and has a large VVIP population.Delhi Police's special cell on Monday reportedly wrote a letter to all concerned departments about two suspected terrorists looking to sneak into the city and stage attacks.LONGSTANDING DEMANDThe police force has had a longstanding demand to strengthen the number of sniffer and explosive-detection dogs, to up to 150, in its squad.""Delhi Police currently has 60 dogs, comprising labradors and German shepherds with the former in majority. However, we are managing the security of the national Capital with the low strength and so we want more such dogs for foolproof security of the city. We have written to IAVC to provide trained dogs,"" said Rajan Bhagat, deputy commissioner of police, who's also in-charge of the dog squad.The officer pointed out that the city also hosts a large number of high-profile events every day. Such functions are on the radar of anti-national elements and so security of these venues is a top priority.The dogs could play a vital role in keeping these events safe. The dog squad, which started in 1960 with 10 dogs in Mandir Marg and Model Town areas in central and north Delhi, is now spread across a dozen Delhi Police districts and special units under the supervision of the crime branch.'DELHI POLICE DEMANDED 100 TRAINED DOGS'Elaborating about the dog squad, Bhagat told MAIL TODAY that the department has 60 dogs in two centres apart from three to four dogs in each districts. Since all 60 dogs are not fit for the job round the clock, Delhi Police want an adequate number of canines in the squad so that security personnel do not come across a shortage.""Delhi Police recently demanded 100 trained dogs from IAVC. Now, it's up to the Indian Army to facilitate dogs to us depending on availability. We have recently built a multistorey building with capacity of 35 dogs at the Saket crime branch office situated on Mehrauli-Badarpur border. It is a first-of-its kind multi-storey building in India for trained dogs and an expected 30-odd dogs would get a home there,"" Bhagat said.Apart from Saket, 18 trained dogs are at the Model Town centre and 10 at the Chanakyapuri one.Indian Army has its own breeding facility, which provides trained dogs to all security agencies in the country including the National Security Guard (NSG). The force prefers to train labradors and German shepherds because of their natural ability to adapt to any schedule and atmospheric conditions.The training periods of dogs last from six to nine months depending on their physical and learning capabilities. After working with security agencies for eight years, the canines are retired and handed over to NGOs working in the veterinary field. However, Millennium city Gurugram only has one sniffer dog to take care of a city with population of more than 25 lakh. ""We are basically using the sniffer dog for bomb detection while daily crimes are cracked manually,"" said a senior official, who wished to remain anonymous. "
"Customs officials at Delhi Airport apprehended alleged smugglers attempting to conceal 5 kg of gold worth approximately ?1.4 crore in microwave ovens, trolleys, toys, wafers and confectionery boxes this week. However, officials added that gold smuggling has decreased since demonetisation. Customs officials seized 240 kg of gold in the 2016-17 fiscal, which was 190 kg less than in 2015-16.","summarize: With security becoming stricter by the day at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA), international criminals are adopting innovative ways to smuggle gold into the country. Custom officials recently busted separate gangs of smugglers who were illegally transporting gold concealed in microwave ovens, toys, wafers and confectionery boxes. This week, officials seized five kilograms of gold in different forms in separate cases worth approximately Rs 1.4 crore. Officials claim two of the smugglers were arrested for illegal transport at the airport. They added that they also seized around a kilogram of gold (996 gm), which was being smuggled as gold foils concealed inside a carton and packing boxes of wafers, confectionery items and toys. GOLD HIDDEN IN METAL BAR OF TROLLEY""The gold foil was so thin and was concealed in such a way that it was difficult to detect it in the X-ray scanning machines,"" said a senior custom officer, adding that a 50-year-old passenger from Dubai was arrested. In another case, smugglers had concealed 1.4 kg gold inside the coil of a microwave oven. ""It is hard to check electronic items as they contain main metal objects,"" the officer said. Over 465 grams of gold was also seized from a passenger coming from Muscat. The gold was hidden in the metal bar of a luggage trolley. According to officials, gold smuggling at the airport has taken a major hit due to demonetisation. Customs officials seized about 240 kg of the yellow metal in 2016-17 fiscal, 190 kg less than the seizure effected in 2015-16. Nearly 355 cases of gold smuggling were reported at the IGIA during the financial year 2015-2016. In these cases, the customs authorities seized 450 kg of gold, valued at a whopping Rs 132 crore (as per prevailing market rates), a senior customs official had said. As a result, about 240 cases of gold smuggling were reported in 2016-17 fiscal.

His characters present a narrative and leave it to the audiences to decide if they want to support or oppose their stand. In fact, it?s his objectivity that makes Rannvijay Singh and Paan Singh (Irrfan in Haasil and Paan Singh Tomar) memorable characters. He operates within the same boundaries in Raag Desh (a classical Hindutsani raga with patriotic sentiments) as well. We know the story of Subhash Chandra Bose?s Indian National Army (Azad Hind Fauj, INA) and how it became a major player in India?s struggle for independence before Bose?s sudden disappearance from Rangoon. We have also heard the stories of three decorated officers of the INA, Shah Nawaz Khan (Kunal Kapoor), Prem Sehgal (Mohit Marwah) and Gurbaksh Dhillon (Amit Sadh), and how they turned into the symbol of unity in diversity during a court case against the British government two years before the Indian independence. Watch: Our Facebook Live discussion on Mubarakan, Indu Sarkar and Raag DeshRaag Desh is a detailed break-down of this famous case which revealed how vulnerable the British regime had become. It was also important because Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi were taking interest in the case. Probably they knew that the trial of three officers will have a favourable impact on Congress? demand for complete sovereignty.It?s an interesting premise. The film claims that close to 25 lakh Indians fought for the British Army in the World War Two. Out of these, 40,000 Indians surrendered to Japan after its win over Britain in Burma and nearby areas. The Japanese government later made the Indian troops collaborators in their war against the allied forces. An Indian officer, Mohan Singh, was appointed the incharge of this troop, but later Subhash Chandra Bose (played by Kenny Basumatary) took control and gave birth to the INA.The actual film begins when trials start and the British regime decides to handle it with an iron fist. Raag Desh finds its flow here and Tigmanshu Dhulia slowly absorbs us into the terrific detailing of the case. Bhula Bhai Desai (Kenneth Desai), a lawyer on the verge of retirement, helps Dhulia in getting the perfect narrative tone for the film.Disgusted with the Congress which refused to give him a ticket to contest the general elections, Bhula Bhai puts aside his differences with Nehru to plead the case of three men whose patriotism is dependent on one ruling.However, Bhula Bhai is just a face as many fight in the background. From a former judge to a helpless father, this faceless crowd constitutes people from all walks of life. They all understand the value of the judgement and how it can change the entire discourse.Dhulia doesn?t manipulate the court proceedings to earn our sympathy. After all, it?s a film with heavy patriotic fervour, nobody would have minded that, but he sticks to the facts and narrates the story of all the major characters from a neutral perspective. There lies the real beauty of his storytelling as the ambiguity around the lead characters remain till the last moments, and even when it clears you are left with many angles to think about.In one of the scenes, Gurbaksh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan put words to such sentiments. One of them believes that the outcome of the trial gives the British an edge while the other categorically demonstrates how the heavy public outcry can influence their case.This isn?t the most powerful scene in the film though. It?s a conversation between Nehru (Rajesh Khera) and Judge Sehgal (Kanwaljeet Singh) when the latter successfully convinces the former to fight for the three officers inside the court. The dialogues show the director?s delicate understanding of the Indian polity and society.The audience keeps watching everything from a distance when the INA officers disclose their side of the details. It becomes a party to the discussion only when it realises that deciding war crimes is very subjective in nature.Then there are actors like Kenny Basumatary and Mrudula Murali (Captain Lakshmi Swaminathan) who bring a distinct charm to the film. Basumatary?s jovial face while he is weighed against gold makes everything look cheerful.The back and forth in narration hampers the flow, though. Further, the documentary-like feel hampers the drama to reach its zenith, but these are minor issues and can be easily overlooked.What matters is Amit Sadh resurfaces as an able actor after a long time. Kunal Kapoor?s matured take on the life of Shah Nawaz Khan is another plus of Raag Desh. Mohit Marwah also holds his ground and infuses seriousness into the film.There is a strange thing about patriotic films. You know what?s going to happen, but your eyes still get moist when it happens. The same will happen to you as well when Kadam Kadam Badhaaye Jaa will play on the screen. This 137-minute soldier versus traitor story is totally worth your time. Interact with Rohit Vats at Twitter/@nawabjha"

Doctors treating her at a private hospital said on Thursday evening that she was stable and managed to speak though a blood clot was detected in her brain.Her uncle, HC Bhatia, told HT that she had received multiple injuries to her brain nerves.Kalra gained consciousness briefly on Wednesday night to tell police she was attacked, but fell unconscious soon after.Police said they registered a case of attempt to murder and that the attack was possibly carried out with iron rods but were clueless about possible suspects. ?We have no eyewitnesses of this attack. We were informed about a woman lying unconscious in the park by a visitor. But the caller had not witnessed the attack,? said Milind Dumbre, deputy commissioner of police (north-west). Kalra lives with her family in Delhi.The park where she was attacked is a popular destination for morning and evening walkers. Kalra?s family said there were many people in the area at the time, but that no one had come forward as eyewitness. According to the police, at least four fatal attacks have been reported from public parks in north and northwest Delhi in the last two years.Her family said like most evenings, she left for a walk in Picnic Hut --a park adjacent to her home -- around 6.15pm on Wednesday. ?At 7.30pm, Kalra?s sister received a call from police that she was admitted to Deep Chand Hospital with brain injuries,? said Bhatia.Kalra was taken to Fortis Shalimar Bagh late at night with frontal-lobe fractures in her skull. ?She was brought in by her sister, who had earlier taken her to Deep Chand Hospital, which referred her to Fortis. She had a lot of fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) collection in her brain cavities, and underwent an emergency surgery to remove it at late night,? said a doctor treating her at Fortis. The condition, called hydrocephalus, can kill if the fluid is not removed. On Thursday, she had to undergo a repeat CT (computed tomography) scan to check if fluid collection had stopped in her brain.The family is unsure about the motive of the attack. ?She is a brave woman, but we are not aware of her enmity with anyone,? said Bhatia.The family initially suspected Kalra was attacked by people who may have tried to snatch her mobile phone. ?But later we checked to find that she had left her phone at home while leaving. She was not carrying any valuables either,? he added."

"The UP government on Sunday approved a ?47-crore package to ensure immediate availability of drinking water in the parched Bundelkhand region. Bundelkhand was continuously ignored in the last 15 years and no steps had been taken to ensure the holistic development of the region, said UP CM Yogi Adityanath.","summarize: Bundelkhand Lucknow, Apr 2 (PTI) The Yogi Adityanath government today approved Rs 47 crore package to ensure immediate availablility of drinking water in the parched Bundelkhand region. The UP Chief Minister also said that if needed, the state government would make available additional funds under this head, but there should not be any problem of drinking water for the people and the cattle in Bundelkhand region. ""Adityanath is also expected to visit the region this month,"" a UP government spokesperson said. The UP Chief Minister said that Budelkhand was constinuously ignored in the last 15 years and no steps had been taken to ensure the wholistic development of the region. Adityanath said he was aware of the hardships faced by the people of the region. ""Now, the state government will make all efforts to ensure the development of the region in a planned manner,"" the spokesperson said quoting the Chief Minister. During his Deoria to Dilli Kisan Yatra in September, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had accused the Uttar Pradesh government of failing to improve situation in the Bundelkhand region, which was battling continuous drought. ""The requirement in Bundelkhand is different and it needs to be addressed differently,"" he had said at a khat sabha in Banda. Rahul had alleged that the Congress-led UPA government had given a special package to the area, but the SP government in Uttar Pradesh did not lend support to improve the situation in the region. In April last year, the Centre had said that farmers in Bundelkhand will get Rs 1,304 crore for drought relief under National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF). Also mandays under the MNREGA was increased to 150 as a review was undertaken by the Prime Ministers Office of the situation in the region. The CM also decided that the National Rural Livelihood Mission will be intensified and would be extended to all the blocks for alternative sources of income, construction of water tanks and building of dug wells and farm ponds on a priority basis under various projects and schemes for Bundelkhand. At a review meeting, held on the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and attended by the Chief Secretary of Uttar Pradesh, it was decided that the Centre and the state government will work together for long-term sustainable solutions to address the problem of vulnerable regions in natural distress. In May 2016, a water train had led to a war of words between the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government when it arrived Jhansi without the ""promised"" 70,000 litres of water. The train was sent from Madhya Pradeshs Ratlam district for the drought-hit Bundelkhand on the instruction of Railway Board, days after a similar arrangement was made for Latur in Maharashtra. SP members on May 6, 2016 walked out of Rajya Sabha charging the Centre with playing petty politics by sending an empty water train to drought-hit Bundelkhand region. "
"Railway Ministry is planning to introduce an integrated ticketing system in the next three years, which will be first introduced in Mumbai on pilot basis. The system will provide all-in-one tickets for all public transportation in the city including BEST buses, local trains, Metros, black-and-yellow taxis and autorickshaws. The MMRDA will reportedly float a tender for the system in October.","summarize: The railway ministry plans to introduce its ambitious integrated ticketing system in the next three years and Mumbai will be the first city to experience it. The project will be implemented in the city on a pilot basis and if it?s successful, it will be introduced in other metro cities. Primarily a Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) project, the system will integrate all public transport ? BEST buses, local trains, metros, black-and-yellow taxis and autorickshaws. The ministry hopes that more than 80 % of the city?s suburban commuters will opt for the all-in-one tickets. Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) and Central and Western Railway officials are currently studying different ways to sync the new software with the existing system. The project will be executed in two stages: in the first, the software will be integrated with the existing ticketing system and in the second, entry and exit gates will be installed at stations. Railway authorities also hope the new ticketing system will reduce losses as it will need less manpower. The railway panel?s findings will be submitted to MMRDA and the railway board in August. ?MRVC will present the railways? perspective to the MMRDA, which is the primary organisation for the integrated ticketing system,? said Prabhat Sahai, chairman and MD, MRVC.Sources said chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is keen on the project.  The Brihamumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST), which runs bus services, and Mumbai Metro One Private Limited (MMOPL), which manages the Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar Metro, have agreed to modify their ticketing systems for the new tickets. With new Metro lines coming up in the city, MMRDA said the single ticketing system would be a boon to travellers. The consultants for the Metro lines will submit a detailed report to the body on the system?s implementation. According to sources, the MMRDA is likely to float a tender for the single ticket system in October."
"At the first summit of BRICS Foreign Ministers in China, India said that there is no difference between 'good' and 'bad' terrorists and all of them should be treated as criminals threatening global peace.

Gen Singh's message in Beijing took on added salience, considering that the Chinese government has been a prominent obstacle in other fora, such as the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), to India's attempts to sanction terrorists based in Pakistan.While not mentioning Pakistan, Gen Singh, who was attending the meet as External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj was unable to travel for health reasons, struck an optimistic note in a press conference following his summit with the foreign ministers of Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa. He said ""all BRICS countries agreed that terrorism is the common enemy of humankind and are fully concerned about the threat of terrorism in its various forms and manifestations"".""On behalf of India, I pointed out that terrorism remains one of the most potent global menaces.

He said ""India looks forward to strengthening and deepening its strategic partnership and mutual dialogue with China.""Wang was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency that ""China and India are both major countries with great influence, and that they should boost cooperation in the BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and all other multilateral frameworks to make contribution to peace and stability in the region and the world at large.""This is the first major visit from India after Delhi became the only major country to boycott President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road summit on May 14.External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had been scheduled to attend Monday's first ever standalone BRICS foreign ministers' meeting.

But she was looking forward to meeting you.""The ministers on Monday called on Chinese President Xi Jinping. Xi's government is going all out to ensure the BRICS summit in September, which Xi will host in Xiamen in Fujian province where he was earlier a provincial leader, will be seen as a success, with the Communist Party of China also hosting a key once-in-five-year leadership congress, likely to be held in Beijing the following month.

The Administration of Union Territory Daman and Diu has revoked its order that made it compulsory for women to tie rakhis to their male colleagues on the occasion of Rakshabandhan on August 7. The administration was forced to withdraw the decision within 24 hours of issuing the circular after it received flak from employees and was slammed on social media.,"summarize: The Daman and Diu administration on Wednesday withdrew a circular that asked women staff to tie rakhis on male colleagues after the order triggered a backlash from employees and was ripped apart on social media.The union territory?s administration was forced to retreat within 24 hours of issuing the circular that made it compulsory for its staff to celebrate Rakshabandhan at workplace.?It has been decided to celebrate the festival of Rakshabandhan on August 7.

The circular was withdrawn through a one-line order issued late in the evening by the UT?s department of personnel and administrative reforms.?The circular is ridiculous.

Delhi civic bodies reportedly plan to make the acts of littering in public places and allowing mosquito breeding in households criminal offences with appropriate jail terms. The imprisonment will vary from one month to six months depending on the severity of the violation. This comes after Municipal Corporation officials said existing penalties were too weak to deter violators. ,"summarize: Trash the city and you may end up behind bars.To deter litterbugs, Delhi's BJP-ruled civic bodies are planning to make discarding of waste in public places and even allowing mosquito breeding in households a criminal offence with appropriate jail terms under the Indian Penal Code.The East Delhi Municipal Corporation has already issued orders in this regard and the two other agencies will follow suit, officials said. Municipal magistrates will keep a check on violators and ensure they are prosecuted. A person can get a maximum jail term of six months for such an offence.The Narendra Modi government last year directed states to start levying fines for littering, open defecation and public urination as the Prime Minister's flagship Swachh Bharat Mission failed to have the desired effect in urban areas. 'EXISTING PENALTY TOO WEAK'According to MCD officials, the existing penalty on violating sanitation bylaws is too weak to deter people and so it was decided to slap criminal charges on them. The imprisonment would vary from one month to six months depending on severity of the violation.""To keep Delhi free of littering and insanitary conditions, various provisions of IPC and the Delhi Municipal Corporation (DMC) Act may be invoked against the violators...departments may proceed accordingly,"" said an order issued by the chief law officer of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation.Public spaces in the Capital often are eyesores full of rotting piles of garbage along the streets, in neighbourhoods, public parks and playgrounds, and outside fancy air-conditioned malls and five-star hotels. HIGH COURT INSTRUCTIONSThe move from the corporations follows instructions of the Delhi High Court to maintain proper sanitation in the city. The court had recently pulled up the three civic bodies and had said that even citizens should take the responsibility of keeping their surroundings clean. The HC directed that a time-bound garbage collection system be set up to prevent the piling of waste. A senior MCD official said mosquito breeding in households is a key concern of the civic body as this could result into the outbreak of vectorborne diseases like dengue and chikungunya. ""Cases of dengue in recent years have been on the rise, claiming several lives. The occupants of a house where dengue larva is found may be booked for endangering public life and causing health hazards. The provision attracts a fine and imprisonment of up to six months,"" he said. Similarly, negligence by people that is likely to spread fatal diseases would also be dealt with strictly. The civic body has identified 14 provisions under IPC to deal with sanitation woes. Any pollution that may cause fouling of drinking water has also been put in the category of criminal offences. 'FAILED ATTEMPTS' Officials said repeated attempts by the MCDs to amend the sanitation bylaws for higher penalty have failed to yield results. The draft of the amendment is pending with the Delhi government for the last seven years. The modified rules would have provision for hefty penalties up to Rs 10,000 and five times higher for repeated offenders. Apart from the fine, the civic bodies have also proposed widening the ambit of the law. Littering caused by distributing food material (langar), illegal burning of solid waste, improper storage of construction material and non-segregation of recyclable and nonrecyclable waste will attract fines. These activities were till now undefined and so exempted from prosecution. The MCDs proposed to increase the fine for littering caused by langars to Rs 5,000, while penalty for dumping construction material on roadside was fixed at Rs 10,000. The proposed amendment prescribed a fine of Rs 500 for littering, spitting and urinating in public places. It also empowers the municipal magistrates to order community services, like road cleaning, garbage and graffiti removal, in case a person fails to pay the fine. The amendment in ""Delhi Sanitation and Public Health Bylaws"" was proposed by the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) on June 23, 2010 and the civic body had adopted it through a resolution passed by the House."

The election petition has to be filed within 45 days.However, in case of VVPAT machines, the printed paper slips have to be retrieved at the time of counting and sealed in a paper envelope and only these sealed paper slips have to be kept inside the strong room along with the EVMs.It further said, ""The VVPAT machines are not required by the law to be retained in strong room for the purpose of election petition and are available for use in any other election. However, in the on-going bye-polls only VVPAT machines which were kept in reserve and not used during the actual poll, have been redeployed.""""Aspersions have also been cast on EC that EVMs from Uttar Pradesh were moved to Bhind, Madhya Pradesh.

No EVMs have been moved from Uttar Pradesh for the purpose of bye-polls in Madhya Pradesh,"" it said.The statement claimed that required number of VVPAT machines was moved from different states for use in bye-polls as per the existing policy of EC. ""This is because 53,500 VVPAT machines, available with the Commission, were deployed during the recently concluded polls in five states - Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur.""The Commission would like to clarify that in any election a certain percentage of EVMs and VVPAT machines are kept in reserve so that EVMs and VVPAT machines deployed on the poll day can be replaced, if required. The EVMs and VVPATs kept in reserve also go through the stringent protocol of first level checking, randomisation and loading of symbols during the candidates setting in the presence of representatives of candidates and political parties. Hence, the VVPATs that were sent to Bhind had the previous symbols loaded from Uttar Pradesh,"" it said.EC said, ""This is a standard protocol and there was nothing amiss in this. According to standard protocol, the old symbols are erased only during first level checking before the next poll. However, it was not done when the demonstration was made on March 31, 2017 at Bhind. As per the Commission's instructions, any training or demonstration is commenced only after completing the first level checking which was missed out at Bhind for which Commission has replaced the District Election Officer,"" and added that the report of special officer deputed to inquire into allegations of multiple printing of paper slips of a particular political party at Ater (Bhind) is awaited and would be made public.Also Read:EVM software is bugged, dare Election Commission to reveal its name to us: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal"

Harry Potter author JK Rowling has apologised for a series of tweets in which she falsely accused US President Donald Trump of refusing to shake the hand of a child in a wheelchair during an event last week. Rowling was slammed for not removing the tweets from her social media account after her comments were proved to be incorrect. ,"summarize: London, Aug 1 (PTI) Renowned Harry Potter author J K Rowling has apologised for wrongly accusing US President Donald Trump of refusing to shake the hand of a 3-year-old disabled child during an event. The 52-year-old British novelist, best known as the author of the Harry Potter fantasy series, said yesterday that she deleted her July 28 tweets after she was informed that they were ""not a full or accurate representation"" of what had happened at last Mondays health care event at the White House. Rowling came under fire for a series of now-deleted tweets in which she slammed Trump for seeming to ignore Montgomery Weers outstretched hand. ""How stunning, and how horrible, that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the president,"" the author had said. But Marjorie Kelly Weer, mother of Montgomery, said Rowlings interpretation of the clip was wrong. ""Re: my tweets about the small boy in a wheelchair whose proffered hand the president appeared to ignore in press footage. Multiple sources have informed me that that was not a full or accurate representation of their interaction,"" Rowling tweeted.

"Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said the number of H-1B visas for Indian IT professionals will not come down. ""No need to get panicky... The lottery process is something I suppose they wanted to do a correction on,"" Sitharaman added. The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialised fields. ","summarize: New Delhi, May 20 (PTI) Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today sought to calm frayed nerves on the contentious visa issue, saying the number of H-1B visas for Indian IT professionals would not come down. She asked the industry not to get panicky. ""No need to get panicky on the visa front. The lottery process is something I suppose they (the US) wanted to do a correction on. The numbers are not something they are changing... the numbers will not come down,"" Sitharaman told reporters here. Over the past few weeks, there is a growing sentiment of protectionism across various developed economies, including the US, seeking to safeguard jobs for locals and raise the bar for foreign workers. In the US, the Trump administration wants to replace the current lottery system with a more merit-based immigration policy. A mere 17 per cent of total US visas go to Indian companies and a number of American firms benefit from services provided by Indian firms, she noted. India has time and again expressed hope that the review of H-1B visa process will take into consideration the positive relationship between the two countries. Any change in visa norms can affect the movement of labour as well as spike operational costs for IT players. In response to the proposed tightening of the visa regime, Indian IT firms have been ramping up hiring of locals in the US, a market that accounts for almost 60 per cent of the Indias technology export revenues. On changes in the selection process for H-1B visa, the minister hoped that ""where the high skill set is required, they (US) would look for that, rather than for first time graduates"". The selection for such visas is getting selective, but the ""numbers are not changing"". ""No need of getting panicky... because the number of H-1B visas that we have got, we will continue to get that,"" she promised. US President Donald Trump in April had signed an executive order for tightening the H-1B visa programme to stop its ""abuse"" and ensure the visas are given to the ""most- skilled or highest paid"" petitioners, a decision that is seen to impact Indias USD 150 billion IT industry. The Indian IT industry expressed serious concern over the issue as these visas were mainly used for short-term work in the US. The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialised fields. Indian technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year for their US operations. "

That man?s Roger Federer. He?s through to play Tomas Berdych on Friday. The other semi will be contested by Marin Cilic and Sam Querrey.

Djokovic is the 10th player to retire. ?We?ve had a very long, very tough year with a lot of matches. Bodies have taken a lot physically. As an athlete, one way or another you are going to experience this kind of thing. Injuries are part of sport.?

Djokovic continues. ?The intensity and level of pain was increasing as the days went by. I was feeling it since the beginning of the tournament. I kept doing everything with my physiotherapist. It was only getting worse. Today was the worst day. Probably the fact I played yesterday, days adding up, it wasn?t helping. I?m not a specialist but I?m going to speak with some and understand what needs to be done. I haven?t considered not starting. I always like to give it a shot and step on the court. That?s all I could do.?

6.29pm BST

Djokovic says he will talk with specialists to see how he can solve the problem. He says he needs to rest.

Was it challenging to play back-to-back days? ?Those kind of circumstances don?t really help. At the end of the day it?s the kind of situation you have to accept. I spent two hours on the table. It wasn?t to be. For an athlete there is no way out if you don?t feel fit.?

Novak Djokovic speaks. ?It?s not the shoulder, it?s the elbow that keeps bothering me. For over a year and a half actually. It?s unfortunate I have to finish Wimbledon in this way. I was able for 30 minutes to play with some pain that was bearable. All the treatments and medication couldn?t help.

","summarize: Sex education has finally entered the hinterlands of Haryana as a think-tank from ministries of human resource development, women and child development and health is set to start educating students on sex, contraceptives and natural urge in the state's government schools under Centre's National Health Mission Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram.The aim of classes on sex education in Haryana's Yamunanagar is to end the stigma around sex and prevent teenage pregnancy culture from picking momentum.The lessons will include treating sex as a natural desire and not an equivalent of a disorder. The educational module has a target audience of class 8th to 12th and is also expected to expand to anganwadis in Haryana.The module will include educating students on sex education, nutrition demands of a body during adolescence, sex and reproductive health, gender violence, substance abuse.The team members constituting representatives of state health department, WCD department and education department highlight that in some schools in Haryana, female students are attended only by male teachers, which adds to hesitation around the conversation on sex education.FOCUS ON ABOLISHING STIGMA AROUND SEXAiming to establish a progressive discourse, team members and teachers are being trained to sensitise students on how the attraction to opposite sex is a very natural phenomenon. The focus will be on ensuring that sex is treated as a need without any disgust. ""We cannot emphasise enough on how there is a dire need to abolish the stigma around sex,"" Dr Dharamveer Singh, assistant project coordinator and member of the committee told Mail Today.The lessons, to be delivered in the government schools and anganwadis, will highlight that indulging in sex entails social and health consequences. This will precisely solve the naive conundrums in a teenagers head, said Dharamveer.""It is currently targeting every block of Yamunanagar with a sole aim to make the teens understand that sex is acceptable but pregnancy before maturity is not,"" Dr Sunil Kumar, deputy civil surgeon and a member of the project from State Health Department said."

This time, the National Award-winning filmmaker delves into the murky world of Delhi and the unconventional relationships that take wing in the shadow of the city?s high-class lifestyle, with Shab. With his brilliant understanding of human emotions, Onir takes a leap into the ?forbidden? love stories of the society with his latest venture.Shab traces the lives of four characters - their personal struggles and love lives. Mohan (Ashish Bisht) is a small-towner who travels from Dhanaulti to Delhi with the hope of becoming a successful model. He is rejected at a talent hunt after being mocked for his ?lack of finnese? and is ridiculed for his broken English. One of the judges, however, finds her fantasy in this young man and there starts our first love story. She is Sonal Modi (Raveena Tandon), a rich trophy wife whose husband has no interest in her life. She decides to make Mohan her boy-toy. Meanwhile, Mohan meets Raina (Arpita Chatterjee) and Neel (Areesz Gandii) who appear to be caring, helpful and hard-working people and offer him all the help he needs. While Neel is recovering from a broken relationship, Raina appears to be mostly concerned about her younger sister?s well-being even as she nurtures some darker secrets. Onir?s expertise is seen in the way he handles these characters and their stories - his sensible filmmaking is written all over the frames. Even when showing stereotypical mindsets in our society, he makes it a point to balance out the narrow-minded comments by placing sane-minded characters nearby, giving them at least one or two jibes to throw at the prejudiced characters. Shab is the darkest film Onir has made till date. With the film, he explores the ?morally wrong? shades of human relationship without letting the audience hold any judgments - he shows us the emotional turmoils of people in these relationships. Though the reason behind such endeavours is revealed much later in the film, what we get to witness, are the everyday struggles. Of the four main characters, Onir seems to give a bigger window into the hearts of Mohan and Sonal. Raveena Tandon has given one of her most sensual, brilliant performances in Shab. She manages to bring out every single element of a rich and lonely trophy wife who does not shy away from paying up for the love she desires. She is authoritative, demanding and dominant when Mohan but becomes a loyal, caring wife when sitting beside her husband (Sanjay Suri) in a party. Her last scene, where she is told that her credit card is blocked, is something you will appreciate the most. When asked to pay up later at a hotel, she takes off her jewelry, places them at the counter and tells the man behind the cash counter, ?Tell my husband that her wife has kept all this for guarantee?. And the masterstroke comes when she places her heels at the counter as well. Ashish has an air of innocence about his presence that adds to the credibility of his character and makes his efforts shine through. Shab is a dark, haunting film about human emotions, relationships, love and betrayal that thrive in a rather opportunistic and materialistic world of Delhi?s elite society.

"A British teenage girl who allegedly married an Islamic State militant over Skype has been accused of plotting a terror attack in the UK, reports said. Indoctrinated by extremist ideology, the girl reportedly tried to get a gun and grenade. The teenager is accused of received instructions on how to use the weapons allegedly between December 2016 and April 2017.","summarize: A teenage girl is alleged to have married an Islamic State fighter in Syria via Skype and became so indoctrinated that she tried to get a gun and grenade to stage a terrorist attack against Britain. The girl, who cannot be named because of her age, appeared at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday charged with the alleged plot.She is believed to be from a Moroccan background and was aged 16 when she met the alleged Isis terrorist, who originally comes from Coventry, online. He is now believed to be dead, killed in a drone strike in April.The teenager, from London, is accused of receiving instructions on how to use the weapons and asking for help in carrying out the plot. The case is said to have involved explicit foreign direction, and the plotting is alleged to have happened between 1 December 2016 and 12 April 2017.The accused was aged just 16 when she ?married? the Isis fighter via Skype, in an online ceremony. There is considerable doubt that it would be considered valid under either Islamic or British laws. The man is understood to have used the internet and social media including Skype, an online voice and video communications programme.During Wednesday?s short court hearing, her lawyer, Vajahat Sharif, said that the girl would plead not guilty. In court, the teenager, wearing a Nike tracksuit and with her long black hair tied in a ponytail, spoke only to confirm her name and age.District judge Tan Ikram remanded her in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on 11 August. She will also appear there on the same date in relation to another terror offence for which she had previously been charged.In a statement the Metropolitan police said the teenager had been charged with having ?the intention of committing acts of terrorism engaged in conduct in preparation for giving effect the that intention?.The elements of the offence, the Met said, were: ?i. Communicating with a Daesh [Isis] fighter in Syria and arranging to receive weapons in order to conduct an attack in the UK; ii. Receiving instructions on how train and use weapons; iii. Reaching out to another to receive assistance in completing plan.?Last week, Met commissioner Cressida Dick said: ?Six attack planning plots were thwarted in the last four months alone, and we can expect that figure to rise.?Britain?s top police officer added: ?The bulk of this domestic threat seems to be from those who are inspired by overseas networks, though there have undoubtedly been some who have been more directly enabled by them also, and we should not assume that attempts by senior leaderships of overseas groups to direct more or less sophisticated UK attacks have gone away.?The terrorist threat level from Islamist inspired terrorism in Britain remains at severe, meaning that an attack is considered highly likely. Three such attacks have claimed lives in Britain since 22 March."

Accordingly, comparison of 8% in 2013-14, 26% in 2014-15 and 34% in 2015-16 is not appropriate,? said Milin Sawant, DMC (education) in the letter.Officials further said that the data was used by the NGO conveniently without bringing the fact of procedural change in screening in public domain.?It appears from the language used in your foreword, that the aim of the whole exercise was to malign a public body. This has completely shaken the credibility and robustness of your report and your organisation,? the officials said.Nitai Mehta, Founder and Managing Trustee of the Praja Foundation, in the foreword of the report had written, ?We cannot compare Mumbai to Shanghai if many wards in the city have malnutrition rates worse than sub-saharan Africa.?The letter further mentions that NGO Praja foundation should issue a public explanation or public apology, and if not, be ready to face legal action.

"White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci has been removed from his job within the first 10 days of his appointment. This comes after Scaramucci, a Harvard law graduate and former Wall Street financier, launched a foul-mouthed tirade against two of his senior colleagues at the White House last week. ""The president felt his comments were inappropriate,"" Trump's spokeswoman said.","summarize: Donald Trump hailed ?a great day at the White House? following the removal of communications director Anthony Scaramucci after just 10 days in a move that has only increased the sense of chaos at the heart of the Trump administration.His evening tweet came as Scaramucci was forced out following a turbulent series of media appearances over the last week by the combative former Wall Street financier, capped by a foul-mouthed tirade to a New Yorker journalist on Thursday.His shock political demise was precipitated by the appointment of former US marine Gen John Kelly as Donald Trump?s new chief of staff less than six hours earlier.?Anthony Scaramucci will be leaving his role as White House communications director,? said press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a statement on Monday afternoon. ?Mr Scaramucci felt it was best to give chief of staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team. We wish him all the best.?A great day at the White House!The decision to remove Scaramucci, nicknamed ?the Mooch?, came at Kelly?s request, the New York Times reported. His removal may take some pressure off Steve Bannon, the longtime Trump aide whose position has been under threat in recent weeks. Scaramucci made Bannon a target in his rant to the New Yorker and, in response, was the subject of repeatedly negative articles on Breitbart, the publication Bannon once ran.Scaramucci was hired on 21 July, months after the departure of Michael Dubke, who had struggled to craft a coherent communications strategy as the administration spun from one controversy to the next. Sean Spicer reportedly opposed the hiring of Scaramucci and resigned as White House press secretary the same day.Spicer was spotted by reporters in the West Wing apparently helping to shape the statement announcing Scaramucci?s removal from office.Scaramucci?s appointment was also reportedly opposed by chief of staff Reince Priebus, who immediately came under fire from the new communications chief for alleged leaks, and was forced out on Friday and replaced by Kelly. As his first act, Kelly in turn seems to have forced out Scaramucci.Asked if Scaramucci had any role now in the White House, the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, told a media briefing: ?He does not have a role at this time.?Scaramucci, loyal and telegenic, was named White House communication director, a move that immediately prompted the resignation of press secretary Sean Spicer.Scaramucci spent his first Saturday on the job cleaning up his Twitter feed to remove historic tweets critical of the president and his agenda.'The Mooch', as he likes to be known, appeared on the Sunday morning politics TV shows. He promised to root out ?leakers? and said any he found would be fired.Scaramucci?s estranged wife, Deidre Ball, gave birth to their second child in New York. Scaramucci traveled on Air Force One with the president to the Boy Scouts annual jamboree.Thumbs up and smiles aboard Air Force One on the way to Ohio.Scaramucci dined at the White House with the president, the first lady, Fox News host Sean Hannity and former Fox News executive Bill Shine. After dinner, he placed a fateful call to New Yorker writer, Ryan Lizza...... The New Yorker published that conversation.The New York Post reported that Scaramucci?s infatuation with Trump was a catalyst for his wife?s decision to file for divorce while nine months pregnant. Meanwhile Trump announces on Twitter that Reince Priebus is out as chief of staff.Scaramucci watched as John Kelly was sworn in as the president?s new chief of staff. Hours later, the White House announced that Scaramucci was out as White House communications director, reportedly at the urging of Kelly.Turning to Scaramucci?s New Yorker interview, she said: ?The president felt his comments were inappropriate.?She would not say whether Scaramucci was fired or had resigned, but added that he had felt ?he did not want to burden Gen Kelly with that line of succession?.Kelly had been given full authority by the president over the White House staff and ?all staff will report to him?, she said.A Long Island native with an affinity for the spotlight, Scaramucci had long drawn comparisons to Trump himself. Both men have deep ties to New York, and Trump was said to admire Scaramucci?s unflinching loyalty.A graduate of Harvard law school and a former Goldman Sachs banker, Scaramucci founded the global hedge fund SkyBridge Capital in 2005, but sold it in 2017 in preparation for a role in the Trump administration. He founded the Salt conference, named after his company, which attracts big name speakers from Washington, Hollywood and Wall Street.Though Scaramucci became a critical fundraiser for the Trump campaign, it was not his first choice. Before the presidential campaign of 2012, Scaramucci expressed early support for Hillary Clinton. ?I hope she runs [in 2016], she is incredibly competent,? he apparently wrote in a deleted tweet from April 2012, according to screenshots published by the Daily Beast. He also called her ?the real deal.?But when the campaign actually arrived, he first donated to Wisconsin governor Scott Walker?s campaign until it collapsed, and then he joined Jeb Bush.Before he joined the Trump campaign, Scaramucci called Trump ?anti-American? and ?another hack politician?.?I?ll tell you who he?s gonna be president of, you can tell Donald I said this: the Queens County Bullies Association,? Scaramucci said during a segment on Fox Business in August 2015. ?You are an inherited-money dude from Queens County. Bring it.?After being hired by Trump, he deleted a number of his old tweets that contradicted the president?s policy positions.His most controversial moment during his short tenure as communications chief was undoubtedly his remarks to a New Yorker interviewer that the then-chief of staff, Reince Priebus, was ?a fucking paranoid schizophrenic? who would be asked to resign (he later was), and that Scaramucci was not like Steve Bannon, the chief strategist, because ?I?m not trying to suck my own cock?.The Washington Post reported that Kelly was ?dismayed? by the interview and found it ?abhorrent and embarrassing for the president?.Named director of communications after having been denied a White House role earlier, the New York financier and Republican fundraiser promptly threatened to fire everyone in his team over leaks. He also staged a combative and contradictory briefing room debut and talkshow tour; sought to bat away questions about suspiciously liberal pronouncements in his past and support for Trump?s Republican enemies; deleted tweets; warred openly with the former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and seemingly forced him out; compared the struggle to take healthcare away from millions of Americans to Lincoln?s battle against slavery; poured obscene invective about leakers, Priebus and Steve Bannon down the phone to a New Yorker reporter; missed the birth of his son; saw his wife file for divorce; and was asked to resign.Trump?s first national security adviser ? one of four generals the president has employed ? resigned after it was revealed he misled Vice-President Mike Pence over his contacts with Russians during the election campaign. It was later reported that Yates had warned the White House Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail.The most shocking firing of them all. Trump sacked his FBI director, by messenger rather than in person, as congressional and justice department investigations into links between Trump aides and Russia gathered pace. Lest anyone retain any doubt about why Trump pressed the big red button, he told NBC in a primetime interview the firing was tied to ?this Russia thing?. The reverberations will be felt for some time yet.The long-suffering but loyal surrogate for the president handed in his resignationin response to Scaramucci?s appointment. A Republican insider and Priebus ally, he never settled into the press secretary role after an infamous debut in which he angrily insisted Trump?s fantastic version of crowd sizes at the inauguration were true. Achieving by way of Melissa McCarthy?s lethal Saturday Night Live impression a somewhat dubious celebrity, his days at the White House were long rumoured to be numbered. His departure on a point of principle having seemingly been justified only 10 days later, he may now claim a sort of hollow vindication.The former Republican National Committee chair stayed loyal ? at least in public ? to Trump through Friday, when he was told his time was up. He stayed loyal after handing in his resignation too, rhapsodising about the president and his mission in interviews with CNN and, of course, Fox News. But it seemed Priebus?s card had alway been marked, less over his initial blocking of Scaramucci, which enraged the Mooch, or by his closeness to the House speaker, Paul Ryan, than by his private advice to Trump to quit the presidential race after 8 October, when the infamous Access Hollywood ?Gropegate? tape was published. The Washington Post reported that Priebus was thus never considered a member of the ?Oct 8th coalition?, a name for the inner cabal of Trumpites who have never wavered, however low their boss?s reputation has sunk.Chinese conglomerate HNA Group is currently in negotiations to buy SkyBridge Capital. Scaramucci announced the sale at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, which was meant to free him of potential conflicts of interest before an official appointment.But that sale ? believed to be worth $250m ? is being held back pending a government review, reportedly by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the agency charged with evaluating the impact on America?s national security of the sales of US businesses.Scaramucci?s wife Deirdre filed for divorce recently while nine months pregnant with their second child. Scaramucci missed the birth last Monday because he was traveling with Trump on Air Force One.The firing met with some swift praise on Capitol Hill. Carlos Curbelo, a moderate Republican from Florida who did not support Trump in 2016, tweeted: ?General Kelly is 1 for 1. Let?s keep it going,? tweeted Curbelo.Trump tweeted this morning: ?Highest Stock Market EVER, best economic numbers in years, unemployment lowest in 17 years, wages raising, border secure, SC: no WH chaos!?Additional reporting by Dominic Rushe in New York"
"A restaurant owner in Italy has been offering families a 5% discount if their children are well-behaved. Antonio Ferrari, who does not have children of his own, estimated that about 30% of parents do not know how to handle their children at lunchtime. However, the 40-year-old said he was not being judgemental, adding, ""I imagine how difficult parenting is today.""","summarize: An Italian restaurateur fed up with his customers? lunches being interrupted by rowdy children has come up with a novel solution: a discount for well-behaved families.Antonio Ferrari, who owns a wine bar in the northern city of Padua that caters to families on Sundays, came up with the idea when he spotted a party of 11 at one of his tables, including five children sitting ?with much composure?.Ferrari rewarded the group with a 5% sconto, and has since bestowed the same discount on two other families with well-mannered children.Ferrari told the Guardian he estimated about 30% of parents did not know how to handle their children at lunchtime, and that too often children run around the restaurant and bother other customers, forcing his waiting staff to swerve to avoid them.Long family lunches, sometimes stretching to three hours, are still an honoured culinary and social tradition in Italy, though less prevalent than they once were. Usually the meal involves an antipasto ? bruschetta or platters of prosciutto are fairly typical ? and then a pasta dish, followed by a meat dish and then vegetables.Unlike the disciplined French children portrayed by Pamela Druckerman in her book Bringing up Bébé who sit quietly through restaurant meals as their parents engage in adult conversation, Italian families are stereotypically more rowdy, with loud behaviour often indulged by parents who see it as as a normal childhood phenomenon.  Ferrari ? who does not have children ? was at pains to point out that his intention was not to be too judgmental, telling Corriere della Sera: ?I imagine how difficult parenting is today.?Nevertheless, he thought something had to be done to rein-in children splashing water in the restaurant?s bathrooms and bothering other customers by running around tables.He recalled some parents telling him his restaurant was essentially public, and that they could do what they want. But he added: ?I?m responsible for what happens in it.?The party who earned the coveted discount were delighted by the news and left a ?30 (£25) tip, Ferrari said. "
"AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala's husband M Natarajan on Monday accused the BJP of trying to destabilise the Tamil Nadu government. ""There are also attempts to saffronise Tamil Nadu but they will not succeed. I will tour the entire state and tear their mask,"" he said. ""I am willing to come anywhere single-handedly, to Gujarat, to UP, anywhere,"" he added.","summarize: Thanjavur, Jan 16 (PTI) M Natarajan, husband of AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala, tonight accused ""some sections"" in the BJP of trying to split the AIADMK and get the state government dismissed. ""They are trying to break the AIADMK and dismiss our government. They are trying to besmirch our government. There are also attempts to saffronise Tamil Nadu but they will not succeed. I will tour the entire state and tear their mask,"" he said. ""We will not allow such conspiracies to succeed...I will face the challenge squarely...I am willing to come anywhere single-handedly, to Gujarat, to UP, anywhere,"" he said while addressing the valedictory session of the three-day Thamizhar Kalai Ilakkiya Pongal Thiruvizha (Tamil art and literary Pongal festival) here. The remarks of Natarajan are significant because he is said to wield considerable influence in the AIADMK, particularly after the demise of J Jayalalithaa, and his allegation against the BJP comes against the souring relations between the two parties. Later when asked by reporters about the attempts to divide the party and dismiss the government, Natarajan said definitely attempts were on at the behest of S Gurumurthy, the RSS ideologue. Significantly, Gurumurthy, who has taken over as Editor of Thuglaq magazine after the demise of founder-editor Cho S Ramaswamy, had made veiled remarks at the annual readers interaction on Saturday in Chennai that while one party was already under the control of a family (apparent reference to DMK), another party was going into the control of a family (AIADMK). Natarajan dared Gurumurthy to come out ""in the open"" and oppose them and ""not hide behind"". He also questioned the security being given to Gurumurthy who held no position in the government. He said while they support Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there were others who were creating problem for the AIADMK. Natarajan said when powerful forces were acting against Jayalalithaa after MGRs death, it was he and his family who had protected her like a shield. ""There were just four or five of us who protected her...for 36 years since then, my wife Sasikala was bearing her on her shoulders,"" Natarajan said delving on the hard sacrifices that he and his family had made to protect Jayalalithaa and thereby preserve the AIADMK from the designs of the rival DMK. He said unnecessary controversies and questions were being raised over Jayalalithaas treatment in the hospital. Her entire treatment has been recorded. She was with a clear mind while in the hospital, he claimed. Complimenting Chief Minister O Panneerselvam of giving able administration, Natarajan said it was his personal opinion that he should continue as CM. "
"Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on Tuesday said the Centre, Delhi government, and the National Green Tribunal should be fined for allowing his foundation to organise the World Culture Festival on Yamuna floodplains in March 2016. ""If the Yamuna was so fragile... they should have stopped the World Culture Festival,"" Sri Sri added.","summarize: Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on Tuesday said the Centre, Delhi government and the National Green Tribunal (NGT) should be held responsible for allowing his foundation to organise the World Culture Festival on the Yamuna floodplains in March 2016 ? if any environmental damage was caused.?If, at all, any fine has to be levied, it should be levied on the Central and state governments and the NGT itself, for giving the permission. If the Yamuna was so fragile and pure, they should have stopped the World Culture Festival,? said Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in a statement issued on Tuesday. The tribunal had allowed the festival on March 11-13, 2016, saying that as the matter was ?fait accompli?, they could not ban it. The three-day World Cultural Festival of Art of Living soon grabbed headlines for allegedly polluting and harming the ecosystems at the Yamuna floodplains.An interim environment compensation of Rs5 crore was imposed on the foundation for its alleged ?environment damaging activities? by the NGT while efforts were made to ascertain the exact cost of the damage.?World over, cultural programmes are held on riverbanks. The whole idea was to bring awareness to save the river. The Art of Living that has rejuvenated 27 rivers, planted 71 million trees, revived several ponds is being projected as destroying a dead river. What a joke,? said Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.Even though the petitioner in the case and convener of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, Manoj Misra, chose to reserve his comments on Tuesday, he had earlier said: ?I have already stated in the petition submitted to the NGT that any activity on the Yamuna floodplains would be violating the green court?s earlier order and would prove detrimental to the floodplain.? ?The Art of Living had obtained all the necessary permission including the NGT?s. The NGT had the application file for two months and they could have stopped it in the beginning. It defies all principles of natural justice that you give permissions and slap a fine for not violating any rules,? the statement read. An expert panel, headed by Shashi Shekhar, secretary of ministry of water resources, submitted a report to the NGT, stating that it would take more than Rs 42 crore and at least 10 years to rehabilitate the floodplain after the damage caused by the three-day festival in March 2016.?I invite all honest environmentalists to study the case and unveil the truth,? he said."

Perhaps if you got your head out of the hemline of the actress of the month and read a book, your vocabulary might improve.?The ?flagbearer of nepotism,? he said, making a reference to the words Kangana used to describe Karan Johar on an episode of his talk show on which Saif was present, ?is the media.??Nepotism is probably least prevalent in the movie industry and rampant in politics and business,? he wrote, speculating that perhaps what Kangana means when she accuses the industry of nepotism, ?is that people from Dharma or Yashraj are against people like her, who have come up the hard way without their support and that they only support their own people.??Whether that is true or not I have no idea and it?s none of my business,?  he conceded.?Nepotism cannot work in the film industry because it is a democracy. The film industry is the most fair line of work. So yes, maybe I got a chance because of my mother, but that is more genetics than nepotism. It?s a genetic investment that the producer was making,? he wrote.Saif also said that ?for every star kid, there are many guys and girls from total non-filmi backgrounds.

The university, however, said that it had given them a list of 10,000 evaluators and it was the firm's job to consolidate it into the desired format.","summarize: Three days before deadline to declare degree college results, MeritTrac, the Bengaluru-based information technology firm carrying out the on-screen assessment of answer sheets, claimed that the University of Mumbai is yet to provide them with a complete list of evaluators causing delay and snags in the assessment process.The firm said they had requested a consolidated list of all evaluators in a particular format, but the university has not given it yet. University officials, however, denied these allegations and claimed that the firm was handed over the required data at the beginning of the project.Speaking to HT, Nagendran S, executive vice-president of MeritTrac said to successfully implement on-screen marking process, one requires complete details about all the evaluators, including the subjects they assess. ?These details were available locally only at colleges and centralised assessment process (CAP) centre. The university didn?t have a consolidated list. We are still receiving evaluator data from varsity officials,? he said.?Unless and until we get the data in a particular format, we can?t generate username and passwords for evaluators. But the list provided by the university was riddled with error,? he said.Rubbishing these claims, Deepak Wasave, in-charge director, board of examination and evaluation at MU, said, ?On the first day of the project, we gave them a list of around 10,000 evaluators. It was their job to put it in the format they wanted,? he said. Wasave, however, accepted that the varsity kept adding new evaluators to the list.He also blamed MeritTrac for slow servers, problems in generating OTPs and mix-up of answer sheets at CAP centres. The company denied the responsibility of these issues. ?There are several factors behind these issues. Sometimes the connectivity of the local area network (LAN) is poor. The generation of OTP also depends on the telecom network. Mix-up of answer sheets occurred due to their mislabelling,? said Nagendran."

"'Judge Uncle' is the presiding deity at the Devi temple in Kerala, and locals believe the judge saves 'innocents' trapped in legal hassles. Eighteenth-century judge Govinda Pillai, known for impartial judgements, had wrongly sentenced his nephew to death. Pillai ordered his own death for the error, and his soul is believed to be confined in a 'stone' at the shrine.","summarize: Neck-deep in legal trouble, a mining baron from Bellary from Karnataka has finally decided to knock on the doors of the ?Judge Uncle? in neighbouring Kerala?s Kottayam district.The judge in this case is the presiding deity of a small shrine located at the corner of the Cheruvally Sree Devi temple of Kottayam with an ever growing reputation of helping people wriggle out of legal mess. The belief is Judge Ammavan (Uncle) does not disappoint and the mining baron mired in legal cases has made the trip to the temple to make a special offering.Those who throng the temple are controversial figures and to give them anonymity, the shrine opens just for 15 minutes and that too only in the night, after the main Cheruvally temple closes after evening prayers.Visitors at the temple are the veritable who?s who of south India: Malayalam actor Dileep is in jail for his alleged involvement in the abduction and sexual assault of a top actress and his brother Anoop was at the temple to offer special prayers on his behalf.P Gopalakrishnan, the president of the Travancore Dewasom Board that administers the famous hill shrine at Sabarimala was also here last November when a petition challenging its age-old tradition of not allowing women into the temple was being heard at the Supreme Court.The top court is yet to give its ruling on whether to allow women into Sabarimala, but devotees of ?Judge Uncle? believe his blessings are a sure shot way to salvation. The Bellary baron is facing a myriad of court cases including some relating to mine lease violations.?One of my cases will come up before the court soon and my astrologer advised me to visit the Judge Uncle,? he said on the condition of anonymity.According to folklore, the temple has its roots in 18th century when the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore had a judge named Govinda Pillai who was known for his impartial judgments. Once, his nephew was involved in a criminal case and Pillai ordered his execution. Later, evidence surfaced about the nephew?s innocence.Pillai was filled with remorse and he approached the king, requesting that he be punished for his erroneous judgment. The king said the judge must decide his own punishment, following which Pillai ordered his own execution. He also ruled that his body be exhibited at a public place for three days.Pillai?s commitment to justice moved many and the people later built a temple to ?give eternal peace to his soul?. The case diary with Pillai?s own observations on Palmira leaves ordering his execution serves as the deity of the temple.?People from faraway places come here. And many believers request the temple to keep their identity confidential,? said temple manager Gopinathan Nair.?People involved in minor disputes to major crimes come here with lot of hope,? said Deva Narayanan, a retired government employee. The Bellary mining baron currently doing the rounds of the temple happens to be just one of them. "

After his return, the actor chronicled his experience via Instagram and Twitter through words, photos and videos. Randeep?s visit was part of an event organised by an NGO. He was also accompanied by singer-composer Kailash Kher. ?The experience was surreal, standing amidst those who have been safeguarding our nation at such harsh terrains. It has to be with so much discipline and, obviously, passion for their jobs. I felt belittled standing amidst them and at the same time, there was a sense of pride. As many as 559 people died in the war and I was reading their names. People from various parts of India coming together at the line of control, laying low their lives for the sovereignty of our country,? says Randeep, sounding deeply moved.    Over the weekend I had the honour and the privilege to visit #Drass where the actual battle of #Kargil took place. I felt belittled even as my chest was feeling full of pride and sorrow. We lost 559 citizens of our country in that war. With the sacrifice of these brave sons we won. Got to know so much more about what happened at the #WarMemorial in #Drass. Every Indian worth his or her salt must go and visit the biggest war memorial in our country. Just to stand there and hear Havildar Kuber Singh and see for themselves the terrain and the sacrifice of our boys standing there defending our borders so that we can pursue our lives in security. The Army and its personnel don't need our sympathy nor encouragement. They are going about doing their job that they have taken an oath to do. It's an organisation that is unfazed about the political going ons and does what it has to do to protect our sovereignty. I had a great time interacting with officers and Jawans. The level of our Jawans has gone so high in the last few years that it is a testament to the citizens wanting to join the forces. The officers are so apt, sympathetic, professional and duty bound that it leaves most of our civilian leaders wanting. I would like to thank Mrs Ruchi Chauhan Khan for making this possible and the great entertainment provided by many,especially, @KailashKher that the evening among the windy mountains was filled with laughter and song. I would also like to thank GOC Major General Cariappa for his gentle and inspiring personality. A towering man with a vision for the future of the army and personal development of its personnel - Brigade Commander and double Shaurya Chakra awardee Brigadier Bhalla, a man of great grace and full of laughter, no doubt a man who commands respect and love of his troops - The Deputy Commander Colonel Pandey for his empathetic and resourceful company - Colonel Vikrant Sharma, a man of great organisational skills and the most disarming smile - and last but not the least by any standards the officer's mess Haviladar ""the boxer"" who's hospitality I shall never forget.

"Reacting to Kajol's recent clarification that the meat she was served was not beef, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said, ""Why is there such fear? Whom should we fear?"" Stating that some people are ""trying to dictate what others will eat"", Mamata added, ""She had to clarify that it was not beef but buffalo meat. It is an alarming situation.""","summarize: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee today reacted sharply to Bollywood actor Kajol's controversy where the actor reportedly clarified what meat she had eaten recently.Speaking at a public rally in North Dinajpur district, Mamata said the actor had come up with the clarification out of fear. She said there was an environment of fear in which everyone was operating.Slamming the BJP, she said, ""Why is there such fear? Whom should we fear? Since I'm always vocal, they threaten us with the CBI and the ED; threaten us with jail all the time. But let me tell them, even if you put entire Trinamool Congress in jail, I don't care. People will give you a fitting reply.""""They only know how to create riots. They are not in favour of Hindu religion, they are a blot on the name of Hinduism,"" Banerjee added. The Trinamool Congress supremo's comment comes after the actor tweeted a clarification that a video that she had earlier shared on social media was not of beef but ""legal"" buffalo meat.""A video of me at a friend's lunch said that there was a beef dish at the table.

A month-long study by the Centre for Science and Environment on 13 Delhi arterial roads has revealed that there is negligible difference between peak and non-peak hours for traffic. The study also found that vehicles were going 50%-60% slower than the speed the roads were originally built for. The analysis also indicated that traffic congestion is worse on weekends. ,"summarize: No matter what time you leave for work, chances are you will get stuck in the Capital?s traffic. A study by the Centre for Science and Environment has found that ?non-peak hours? have almost disappeared on Delhi?s main arterial roads, i.e., there is virtually no difference in travel time between peak and non-peak hours. The month-long CSE study on travel time and traffic speed monitored 13 arterial roads for 12 hours daily. While the average morning and evening peak speeds were recorded at 28kmph and 25kmph, the off-peak speed remained restricted to 27kmph. The analysis, which is based on data from Google Maps, shows that roads in Delhi are more congested on weekends, with an average peak speed of 25kmph, less than the weekday figure of 26kmph.  It was found that vehicles are plying 50%-60% slower than the speed these roads were built for.The 13 arterial roads that were part of the study included heavily congested ones such as Outer Ring Road; Swaroop Nagar to Wazirabad, Mahatma Gandhi Road (Ring Road); Indira Gandhi Stadium Complex to Majnu Ka Tilla and Sri Aurobindo Marg; Lado Sarai to Kidwai Nagar West. Arterial roads are primary networks that provide long-distance travel through multi-modal transport system connecting all major city-level land uses. They also facilitate inter-city and regional trips by connecting with highways and expressway networks.The analysis was done on the basis of data taken from Google Maps that was noted for every hour from 8 am to 8 pm in June.Traffic speedThe study found that all the 13 selected arterial roads had an average peak speed of 26 km/hr, while the off-peak speed was recorded at 27 km/hr, which is 50%-60% lower than the design speed. These roads have been designed to achieve a driving speed of 50-70 km/hr as per the Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning & Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) street design guidelines as well as Indian Road Congress guidelines for urban roads. The regulated speed is 40-55 km/hour.It was also seen that during the 12 hours of the day, around 75% of the time, the average speed is 25-30 km/hr. About 17% of the time, it is 20-25 km/hr and only 8% of the day?s time was the speed more than 30 km/hr.According to a 2010 report by RITES, the average peak speed in Delhi was 27.7 km/hr and off-peak was 30.8 km/hr ? now, this has come down to 26 km/hr and 28 km/hr.Weekends more congestedThe analysis breaks the myth that Delhi?s roads have less traffic during weekends. The analysis says that the average peak speed noted during weekends on these roads is 25 km/hr which is lower than the weekday speed of 26 km/hr. ?This even drops to 8 km/hr on Sri Aurobindo Marg and 9 km/hr on Mehrauli-Badarpur road during peak hours. Evening peaks are worse during weekends ? 21-23 km/hr in contrast to 25-27 km/hr on working days,? said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director-research and advocacy, CSE.While the average traffic speed on Saturday is 21 km/hour, on Sunday it improves slightly to 23 km/hour but remains still worse than weekdays, she added.Lutyens? roads less congested The study states that the average traffic speed in Lutyen?s Zone, which has primary arterial roads with widths up to 50 meters, is considerably higher. The average peak hour speed is 44 km/hr ? almost 40% higher than on other arterial roads. The average off-peak speed is 52 km/hr, which is almost double that on other arterials. There is also a considerable difference between the average peak and off-peak speed. Air pollution worsens with trafficCSE also analysed hourly air quality data for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) ? largely influenced by traffic ? for a selected day. It found that when the average morning peak speed of 28 km/hr drops to 25 km/hr in the evening, NO2 levels increase from 68 microgramme/cubic metre to 94 microgramme/cubic metre ? an increase of 38%. ?This can get worse during winter when inversion builds up during evening,? Roychowdhury said. Traffic from NCR citiesMost of the arterial roads are conduit for traffic from the neighboring NCR cities, the study states. Besides, there are some stretches that are chronically congested. On the stretch from Ambedkar Nagar to Lajpat Nagar on Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg, the average morning and evening peak speed was 16 km/hr and 17 km/hr. ?Speed can even drop to 5 km/hr during evening hours. On Sri Aurobindo Marg from Lado Sarai to Kidwai Nagar West, the average speed is 19 km/hr during the worst peak hours between 6 pm and 7 pm; during weekends it can drop to 7 km/hr,? she added."
"A Public Interest Litigation in  Bombay High Court seeks the scrapping of Maharashtra government's ?3,600 crore Shivaji statue project in the Arabian Sea.

The statue is expected to be built at the cost of Rs 3,600 crore.The PIL has been filed by Mohan Bhide, a chartered accountant and a professor by profession who runs Bhide Kapasi classes in Mumbai. Bhide in his petition states, ""I have full respect and honour for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. But I am against the huge expenditure of hard earned tax payers' money. The project of constructing a statue in the middle of the sea is nothing but a political stunt of all the political parties operating in Maharashtra."" He added that the construction of the statue was ""illogical and uncalled for"".The petition asks for the project to be scrapped. Bhide's petition states that the government has spent Rs 77 crore on the inauguration ceremony when crores of money is needed for construction of the statue. This comes at a time when, ""the government is itself facing financial crunch. Thus it is unnecessary. Last year the government declared drought in over 25,000 villages so the government should focus on addressing these issues first,"" the petition states."

"Actress Gautami Tadimala has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking why the Centre was silent on pressing issues of Tamil Nadu, including the row over Jayalalithaa's death. She alleged that the Prime Minister had ignored Tamil Nadu's concerns. ""Is south India, most specifically Tamil Nadu, not deserving of the attention and accountability of our central government,"" she questioned.","summarize: On a day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was taking on the Samajwadi Party-Congress combine of Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav and BSP Supremo Mayawati at the same time at a rally in Meerut, actress Gautami Tadimala, in a letter, criticised him for ignoring Tamil Nadu's concerns.  Also read | Sasikala set to take charge as Tamil Nadu CM? Decision likely in crucial AIADMK meet tomorrowHere's the full text of Gautami's letter:I have written an open and very direct letter to our Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji, regarding my questions on the tragic demise of Amma, our Honourable Chief Minister Dr. J Jayalalithaa. This letter was published on the 8th of December 2016 through my blog and directly sent to his Twitter handle as well as that of his office. Subsequent to this, the pain and uncertainty I expressed in my letter have been amplified to resonate through the country and our citizens throughout the world. The outpourings of anguish from citizens of Tamil Nadu and all over India, have joined forces with my voice addressed to our Prime Minister. I have addressed our Prime Minister on the most democratic public platform as this is a matter that is of the greatest public relevance and importance.Our Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji, has been one of, if not our earliest, political leaders to embrace the ways of today's modern world. Most specifically in his wholehearted espousal of modern technology and social media. He has been a most vociferous proponent of utilising technology and digital and social media to make communication instantaneous and effective. He has reiterated time and again his accessibility on digital and social media platforms to the common citizen of India. There are several examples of his drive and initiatives to this effect but I will not digress in order to reiterate what is a very well-known fact.If we are to be told today that a letter that was addressed directly to our Prime Minister, the contents of which raged across our nation both on national media and social media, has escaped the notice of his office and therefore himself, it is an extremely devastating reality for us to face. As a political leader, who has promised to listen to his people and bring about true and meaningful change in the way this country has been governed through the past decades, this denying any knowledge even of a justified and rightful query from the very citizens of his country is disappointing to say the least. How is a citizen's query, made with honest intent and immense grief, any less relevant because it has been delivered on a communication platform of modern technology?DOES TAMIL NADU NOT DESERVE PM'S ATTENTION, ASKS GAUTAMIIn the time since writing that letter, I have been steadfast in my faith in my Prime Minister. Faith in his accountability to the people of his nation as per the tenets of democracy. Faith in him as an individual leader who has shown the strength to take harsh and potentially unpopular steps for the betterment of this country. Faith in his word when he said the entire nation is one for him. Then why this denial now? Is south India and most specifically Tamil Nadu, not deserving of the attention and accountability of our central government? Yes, several members of the central government and other officials have travelled back and forth to Chennai during the period of Amma's hospitalisation and ""treatment"" but have we, the people of Tamil Nadu, received even one response to any of our entreaties? To deny answers to our questions and deny justice to Amma is to deny Tamil Nadu itself. Why must we be forced to accept this apathy towards our anguish and uncertainty?AMMA'S DEMISEMy state has been battered for the past several months in unprecedented and shattering ways. Amma's heartrendingly tragic demise that has left an indelible mark upon each of us in different ways. Cyclone Varadha that tore us up and ripped us apart in a storm of huge proportions. We are still, and will be struggling for a long time to come, with the devastating aftermath of this calamity. Our awe-inspiringly peaceful and rightful protest by the people of Tamil Nadu all over the world to uphold the age-old traditions of one of the oldest-known cultures in the world. Our farmers continue to be battered to the point of ending their lives out of sheer hopelessness, knowing their cries are unheard.Through all of these devastating happenings, I, we, have been waiting.  Waiting and hopeful of meaningful support and response from our central government. Respectful of the demands of due process and the inner workings of government and politics. However, there must come a time when we must ask if this silence is more than a preoccupation with matters of ""greater"" importance. What is the message inherent in such a steadfast silence on a matter critical to the very basis of a democratic state and the safety and security of its citizens? A leading politician of our country and the serving chief minister of one of India's foremost states has died in office under conditions that are shrouded in mystery and complete obscurity. As citizens of this state and this nation, we are entitled to have complete knowledge of these details. It is a fundamental confidence and security that a democratic nation owes her people. In addition to this, Amma is a leader who has a lasting and very real bond with crores of her people who love and respect her. Our anguish and our grief must be respected and honoured with answers. With the truth."
