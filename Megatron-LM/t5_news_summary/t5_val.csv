"According to a recent European study, diesel cars are 10 times more toxic than diesel trucks and buses due to stricter European Union testing standards applied to larger vehicles. Nitrogen oxide emissions per kilometre for diesel cars were found to be double that of heavy-duty vehicles. Diesel cars emit about six times more toxic gases than allowed, the study claimed.","summarize: Modern diesel cars produce 10 times more toxic air pollution than heavy trucks and buses, new European data has revealed.The stark difference in emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) is due to the much stricter testing applied to large vehicles in the EU, according to the researchers behind a new report. They say the same strict measures must be applied to cars.NOx pollution is responsible for tens of thousands of early deaths across Europe, with the UK suffering a particularly high toll. Much of the pollution is produced by diesel cars, which on the road emit about six times more than allowed in the official lab-based tests. Following the Volkswagen ?dieselgate? scandal, the car tests are due to be toughened, but campaigners say the reforms do not go far enough.The new report from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), a research group that played a key role in exposing Volkswagen?s cheating, compared the emissions from trucks and buses in realistic driving conditions with those of cars.It found that heavy-duty vehicles tested in Germany and Finland emitted about 210mg NOx per kilometre driven, less than half the 500mg/km pumped out by modern diesel cars that meet the highest ?Euro 6? standard. However, the buses and trucks have larger engines and burn more diesel per kilometre, meaning that cars produce 10 times more NOx per litre of fuel.The ICCT analysis showed that manufacturers were able to ensure that heavy duty vehicles kept below pollution limits when on the road, but that emissions from cars soar once in the real world.Official EU tests for cars are currently limited to laboratory measurements of prototype vehicles. ?In contrast, for measurement of NOx emissions from trucks and buses, mobile testing devices became mandatory in 2013. As a consequence, randomly selected vehicles can be tested under real-world driving conditions,? said Peter Mock, managing director of ICCT in Europe.Changes to the car testing regime in the EU are due to start in September, with mobile devices, called portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS), attached to vehicles as they drive on real roads. But Mock warned: ?Manufacturers will still be allowed to carefully select special prototype cars for emissions testing. Instead, it would be much better to measure the emissions of ordinary mass-production vehicles, obtained from customers who have had been driving them in an ordinary way.? Such a system is used in the US where the dieselgate scandal first emerged. It will also be put forward for discussion by the European commission on 17 January in Brussels, but the ICCT said it faces resistance from some vehicle manufacturers and EU member states.In December, the European commission started legal action against the UK and six other EU states for failing to act against car emissions cheating in the wake of the dieselgate scandal. But later the same month, a draft European parliament inquiry found the European commission itself guilty of maladministration for failing to act quickly enough on evidence that defeat devices were being used to game emissions tests.Evidence that some diesel cars emitted up to four times more NOx pollution than a bus was revealed in 2015. Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP and a lead negotiator on the EU?s air quality law, said ?It is disgraceful that car manufacturers have failed to reduce deadly emissions when the technology to do so is affordable and readily available. The dramatic reduction in NOx emissions from heavier vehicles is a result of far stricter EU tests, in place since 2011, that reflect real-world driving conditions. If buses and trucks can comply with these limits, there?s no reason cars can?t as well.??

"Delhi Police has busted a module that sold information including bank account details and card details of over 1 crore people. Police have arrested an accused in the case, who allegedly sold this data at about 20 paisa per individual. The data was sold to fake call centres, which would use it to obtain victims' one-time passwords to steal money.","summarize: Delhi Police on Thursday said they had arrested a man who they claimed was in possession of the personal bank details of nearly 1 crore Indians.The accused, identified as 33-year-old Puran Gupta, would allegedly sell this data to fake call centres whose employees would in turn use it to call the targeted victims and obtain their one-time passwords (OTPs). Since the fake call centres already had other details related to the credit or debit cards, courtesy Gupta, the OTPs would help them in stealing money.Gupta was arrested from Ganesh Nagar on Monday after the southeast Delhi police began probing a complaint in which a senior citizen from Greater Kailash was duped of Rs 1.46 lakh by a caller who posed as a representative of Citibank and tricked him into revealing his OTP.?Much of the money stolen was transferred to e-wallets and online ewallets such as PayU, Paytm, Olacabs, Mobikwik and Vodafone Bill Pay,? said Romil Baaniya, DCP (southeast). Since the victim was quick to approach the police, the investigators immediately shot off letters to some of these firms. ?Our prompt action led to these firms returning almost Rs 72,000 of the duped amount,? said Baaniya. The police had earlier this month also arrested the owner of a fake call centre, Ashish Kumar Jha, who also used to trick senior citizens and duped their money. When questioned how he had obtained the victim?s credit card details and contact number, he named Gupta.That opened a can of worms. Once Gupta was arrested, a search of his laptop and emails revealed that he was in possession of the personal banking data of nearly one crore Indians. He had stored the data in different folders to meet the exact requirement of his clients.Some of these classifications were based on the age groups, monthly incomes and credit card limits, police said. ?The fake call centres found women and elderly people easy targets,? explained Baaniya as the reason for classification of the data.Apart from the credit and debit card details, Gupta was also found to be in possession of personal data of Delhi University students, lawyers, stock brokers, people interested in night life and those owning cars. He allegedly sold these data for as little as 10 paise per data.But the hot property was the credit and debit card details of people. Police are probing if employees of some banks helped him procure the data. ?He was buying the credit and debit card data for 40 paise per customer. Apart from the card numbers, expiry dates and CVVs, he was able to procure all details filled in the application forms by customers,? said another investigator.A former data entry operator, Gupta, had created a firm that appeared to be involved in data collection, data entry, data market research and online promotion. But he got his firm registered on JustDial which helped him offer the credit/debit card details to fake call centre operators who would call him for data, said the DCP."

The school is also putting restrictions on smartphones to tackle social media's impact on students' mental health.","summarize: A girls? school is banning wearable activity trackers and smartwatches because of concerns that pupils are skipping lunch if they fail to meet their calorie and exercise targets.Teachers at Stroud high school in Gloucestershire fear the gadgets are exacerbating some girls? worries about their body image. The deputy headteacher, Cindi Pride, said the school?s active and healthy pupils did not need to count calories and the number of steps they took each day. She said: ?We are banning Fitbits and smartwatches. These monitor the number of calories burned and we found that some girls would monitor the number of steps they had taken and the number of calories they had used. If they didn?t feel they had taken enough steps in the morning, they wouldn?t eat lunch.?We don?t need our girls to be counting calories. They are young women who are fit and healthy and they do exercise and PE, and do not need to be obsessed with steps or calories.? The move was welcomed ? with reservations ? by a former pupil of the school, Rachel Cross, who had an eating disorder and has set up a support group in Stroud for other people who have similar conditions. She said: ?With young girls it?s very difficult to say if something will lead to an eating disorder or not; using things like Fitbits can just be a cool thing for them to do.?I think I agree with it, but I do have reservations over whether it will actually prevent anyone from getting a disorder if they are on that path anyway. It?s potentially a good precaution to take. If it?s distracting them from work, it?s a good idea anyway. ?It will be interesting to see how it works out. Pupils always try to bend the rules anyway, for example on the length of skirts.?Parents appeared to be on board. One said: ?This is a good move, which addresses important issues in an appropriate and measured way.? When pupils return from their summer break, girls in years 7 to 9 will be banned from using their mobile phones at all during the school day.Those in years 10 and 11 will be allowed to use their mobiles at lunch, and pupils in the sixth form ? which includes boys ? will be allowed to use their phones freely except in lessons. In a letter to parents, the assistant headteacher, Nadine Moore, wrote that fear of missing out was an additional pressure faced by teens through social media. She wrote: ?Being a teenager is hard enough, but the pressures faced by young people online are unique to this digital generation. ?Research suggests that young people who are heavy users of social media ? spending more than two hours per day on social networking sites ? are more likely to report poor mental health. ?Seeing friends constantly ?having fun? can make young people feel like they are missing out while others enjoy life. ?While for many young people fear of missing out (Fomo) may not be a problem, for others it is causing them distress in the form of anxiety and feelings of inadequacy.? Pupils were told about the tight new controls at a school assembly. The letter home added: ?Social media addiction is thought to affect around 5% of young people, with social media being described as more addictive than cigarettes and alcohol.?Remember, this will give your daughters nearly seven hours of freedom from the pressures of social media. For their time in school, they will not have to worry about ?missing out?, or replying quickly enough or knowing about who said what to whom. ?Instead, we will be able to remember that we have real friends in front of us, right now, who we can talk to, play with, have fun with, laugh with. We can share experiences together and value them in their own right, rather than because the picture has been validated by 100 likes on whichever social media platform they use.?"

"Kotak Mahindra Bank MD Uday Kotak has said he would like to see a little bit of ""animal spirit"" in Indian businesses and entrepreneurs to come back.

The Kotak group chief, who has steered one of the most successful banking and financial services sector stories in recent years in India, also favoured nudge from the government and policymakers to the corporates to get that ""animal spirit"" and said the country should also incentivise delta jobs created in any country. Kotak, who was here to attend the World Economic Forum annual meeting that saw China positioning itself as a new champion of globalisation, told PTI in an interview that India has to take its rightful place over the next 5-10 years and the institutions like his will have to contribute to that journey. On Indian corporates in the past having started to look overseas for expansion through acquisitions, but the process stopping thereafter, Kotak said, ""That also probably because of the reason that they did not necessarily take the best capital decisions and probably our timing was wrong."" Asked whether India Inc has learnt its lessons, he said, ""I think, it has. The private sector has become more careful and more sort of thoughtful and therefore, we are seeing a slowdown in investments -- both in terms of external investments as well as within India.

A lot of women say they wear lipstick when they want to feel good. I read somewhere there is nothing that a right shade of lipstick cant fix. So many acts by us are a form of rebellion.""

"While the Opposition in India has raised doubts over the reliability of EVMs, Russia has sought India's EVM technology for 2018 presidential elections, a report has claimed. During the Uttarakhand Assembly polls, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Election Commission, Nikolai Levichev, had visited the state to closely monitor the functioning of EVMs and the electioneering process.","summarize: Russia is hoping to embrace India's EVM technology for its upcoming presidential election, even as Indian politicians themselves continue to debate their efficiency.Russia hopes to learn from ""India's experience"" of conducting polls through EVMs, ahead of the 2018 presidential election, according to a report in The Economic Times.The report says, Nikolai Levichev, Deputy Chairman of the Russia's Election Commission, visited Uttarakhand this year during February's Assembly polls to observe and understand the process of voting through EVMs. He also monitored elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Manipur and Goa and was reportedly impressed with the EVM system as it reduced the role of people in the poll process.Levichev also held ""wide-ranging consultations"" with senior officials in Delhi to learn more about EVM technology and understand its best practices.Russia's interest in EVMs comes at a time when India's Opposition leaders have expressed grave concerns regarding EVM tampering.In a press conference held just yesterday, Aam Aadmi Party's Arvind Kejriwal had alleged tampering on a ""massive scale"" in Madhya Pradesh's Bhind. ""We challenge the Election Commission to make the EVM available to us for 72 hours. We will read the code and rewrite it too,"" Kejriwal said.Alleged EVM tampering has also remained a hug issue in Parliament, with various Opposition leaders disrupting proceedings to protest the issue.In light of tampering allegations, the Election Commission also decided to replace over 9 lakh EVM machines with advanced M3 machines, ahead of the 2019 general elections. These machines will become inoperable the moment someone attempts to tamper with them.Also read: Many countries have banned EVMs since they can rig elections Meanwhile, in a move to return the favour, Russia will assist India in developing a ""state-of-the-art tabulation system"" for counting of votes.

"A prematurely-born girl child, who was declared dead by a male nurse at a hospital in Rajasthan, 'came back to life' on Tuesday at a crematorium where her body was taken for last rites. The on-duty nurse had declared the newborn dead when he noticed that she was neither crying nor breathing, but she suddenly started crying at the crematorium.","summarize: In Rajasthan's Bundi district, a shocking incident shed some light on the sad state of affairs of the health department. A woman had to give birth in the absence of a doctor in a government hospital in Bundi, and the male nurse who assisted her during the delivery told her that her child was dead and should be taken to the burial ground. All this happened in the absence of a doctor. Following the male nurse's advice, the family took the new born for the burial. But few minutes before the burial the child started crying and that's when everyone realised that the baby girl is still alive. They again went to the hospital and complained against the male nurse who misguided them. When the deputy superintendent saw a ruckus, he went on to defend the nurse and said that since the child is born weak, there are hardly any chances of survival. He in fact did not even try saving the newborn's life.Residents of Bundi district are appalled by this incident of negligence and questioned the hospital authorities that if the infant had not cried before the burial then because of the wrong information given to them, the family would have buried her alive. Not only that, deliveries being done in the absence of doctors raises many questions about the functioning of the hospital. Deputy controller Dr OP Verma defended his staff and said that the baby girl was born premature and since there was no movement at the time of birth, she was declared dead. However, the family members believe that if immediately after delivery the infant would have been shifted to the ICU then her health would not have deteriorated."
"Sports Direct's Mike Ashley has won a lawsuit over a £15 million (?126 crore) deal made in a pub in 2013. In the case, a banker alleged that during a ?night of heavy drinking?, Ashley agreed to pay him £15 million if company?s shares doubled. However, the judge said nobody would've thought what Ashley said in the pub was ?serious?.","summarize: Newcastle United owner and Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has won a high court battle over a £15m deal allegedly made in a London pub, calling time on a case that will be long remembered for days of evidence concerning excessive alcohol consumption.The case revolved around investment banker Jeffrey Blue?s allegation that during a ?night of heavy drinking? at the Horse and Groom pub near Sports Direct?s Oxford Street store in January 2013, Ashley agreed to pay him £15m if the company?s shares doubled to £8.However, on Wednesday, Mr Justice Leggatt, who had said he found the case was ?a lot more interesting than some?, ruled that no one would have thought what Ashley said in the pub was ?serious?.?The Sports Direct senior management meetings certainly show that Mr Ashley is happy to combine discussion of business matters with the consumption of alcohol,? the judge said in his ruling. ?But there is no evidence to suggest that Mr Ashley has ever negotiated or concluded a contract at one of these meetings.?The evening at the Horse and Groom was, in any event, a considerably less formal occasion than the senior management meetings, as there was no agenda or structure for the occasion and the conversation was largely social or general chat, rather than being specifically directed to any business subject.? Ashley was not in court to hear the judge deliver his ruling, but his lawyers said he had won a ?comprehensive? victory.In a statement, the businessman said: ?The only reason the Sports Direct share price exceeded £8, and will hopefully do so again, is because of the sterling efforts of all the people who work at Sports Direct.?Ashley, who gave evidence at the trial, said he could not recall making the alleged deal and if he had it would have been ?obviously just banter?.He had told the court that he had met Blue, who was then an adviser to Sports Direct, and three other finance specialists at the Horse & Groom pub and ?consumed a lot of alcohol?.?I can?t remember the details of the conversations that we had in the pub as it was a heavy night of drinking,? Ashley had said. ?I do remember that we had a lot of drinks and a lot of banter. ?If I did say to Mr Blue that I would pay him £15m if he could increase [Sports Direct?s] share price to £8, it would be obvious to everyone, including Mr Blue, that I wasn?t being serious.? He said he paid Blue, whom he called ?Jeffers?, £1m for ?other deals? unrelated to the night in the Horse & Groom.Sports Direct?s shares hit the £8 price target in February 2014. The shares have since collapsed below £3, in part because of reputational damage caused by a Guardian investigation that revealed workers at the retailer?s Derbyshire warehouse were being paid less than the minimum wage.Shortly after the shares hit £8 at 1.04pm on 25 February 2014 Blue?s wife, who was also in court, texted him to say: ?It?s hit 8!!!!!?.Blue told the judge that Ashley was a ?serious businessman?. He said the work ethic at Sports Direct was ?like nothing else I have ever seen?, but he said Ashley sometimes did business ?in unorthodox ways and in unusual venues?.Blue claimed Ashley once vomited into a fireplace after a senior management meeting that was ?effectively a pub lock-in? and said the businessman would take naps under tables at ?boring? meetings.Lawyers told the judge that Ashley had run up legal bills of £1.5m, and Blue bills of ?£1m-odd?. The judge said Blue would have to pick up Ashley?s legal bills and £600,000 would have to be paid on account within the next month.Lawyers indicated that Blue had been ?assisted? by insurers in launching the litigation.

The petition further reads, ""We believe that it is wrong and immoral to kill a human being by way of revenge or punishment.

Notably, the Tribunal has reconstituted the Principal Committee responsible for overseeing the execution of the Yamuna cleaning project.","summarize: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has asked the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh governments to remove debris on the floodplains of  the Yamuna. It said indiscriminate dumping of waste was a direct source of pollution in the river. A bench headed by NGT chairperson justice Swatanter Kumar said the department of irrigation of Delhi and UP would have to carry out these directions. ?The debris on either side of the river Yamuna, if not already removed, shall be removed within three weeks,? the bench said. The green court said work to rejuvenate the Yamuna should not be stopped unnecessarily as pollution was rising daily and any ?inaction on part of authorities cannot be tolerated?.?In the interest of environment and public health, the government and all authorities concerned must perform their function and ensure that the Yamuna is rejuvenated to its original pristine status. Now, the project is being carried on in a planned, scientific and implementable manner and any obstruction in that behalf will not be tolerated,? the bench said.The tribunal reconstituted the principal committee, formed to see the execution of the cleaning of the Yamuna, and included Shashi Shekhar, former secretary of ministry of water resources, as a special invitee.It also convened a meeting of stakeholders, including officials from Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, on August 8 at 3pm at the tribunal to discuss the cleaning and rejuvenation of the Yamuna.During the hearing, the counsel appearing for the Delhi government told the NGT that steps were being taken by the Delhi Jal Board to ensure that work to clean the Yamuna was completed with utmost expeditiousness.?In relation to the project report of the second phase of the Yamuna cleaning, it is submitted that it has already been filed before the tribunal as well as sent to the principal committee, ministry of water resources,? the bench noted.The directions came when the NGT was hearing a plea on the monitoring of implementation of the Maili se Nirmal Yamuna Revitalisation Project 2017 project.The tribunal had earlier banned open defecation and dumping of waste on the floodplains of the Yamuna and announced an environment compensation of R5,000 for violation of the order."
Gurugram police on Wednesday arrested a policeman and a jail convict for allegedly getting a gangster to make a threatening phone call on June 27 from Bhondsi jail. A police official said that the inmate sought help of the gangster to threaten his rival over a property dispute and a policeman was involved in making this happen.,"summarize: Two persons, including a policeman, were arrested by the Gurgaon police for allegedly getting a gangster to make a ?threatening? phone call for mediating in a property dispute in Wazirabad village on Wednesday. Police said  an inmate who was lodged in Bhondsi jail sought the help of gangster Manjeet Mahal to threaten the other group lead by Rakesh, which had claimed the plot on the upscale Golf Course Road. On June 27, the call was made by gangster on behalf of the inmate and ASI Raj Singh was involved in making this happen, a police official said. ?As the phone call was made from inside the jail, it is a very serious matter and two persons, including a policeman, have been booked. The matter will be investigated thoroughly to ensure that such threats are not made again,? said Sumit Kuhar, DCP, crime. Kuhar said the matter was brought to the notice of the police on Wednesday and action was taken immediately as the matter was serious. ?Mahal was taken on production warrant on Friday and if this matter had come to our notice then we could have questioned him earlier,? he added. Ironically, while Mahal was at the Crime Branch, Palam Vihar, four police officials were suspended for drinking liquor during the duty hours inside the office premises. As per the police, the matter pertains to a 500 square yard plot which is claimed by Rakesh, a resident of Jhund Sarai village and another man identified as Rajkumar. On June 8, there was a fight between both groups as a result of which the inmate was booked and sent to Bhondsi jail, where he got in touch with the Manjeet Mahal gang.On Surender?s behest, a phone call was made to Rakesh to leave the plot of land, else he should be ready to face ?the consequences?. However, as the phone call was made from jail, the police got active after getting the complaint and booked the inmate as well as ASI Raj Singh of the crime branch, and took him into custody for further questioning. The Gurgaon police had carried out a major search operation last month in Bhondsi jail and recovered over a dozen mobile phones from the inmates. In fact, a highly placed source said that as the jammers at the jail were inadequate, the inmates used ingenious methods to keep the phones, and use them intermittently to run their extortion and other rackets.

"Speaking about nepotism remarks which followed the announcement of his launch by Yash Raj Films, actor Raj Kapoor's grandson Aadar Jain said that he felt bad and added, ""I'm human after all."" He added, ""Yes, I feel bad when people says things without seeing my work."" Aadar will be seen making his acting debut with YRF film 'Qaidi Band'.","summarize: By Juhi Chakraborty New Delhi, Jul 24 (PTI) Aadar Jains entry in Bollywood comes at a time when the nepotism debate has gained momentum but the newcomer says he would like people to not judge him before seeing his work. Aadar, the grandson of Raj Kapoor, will make his debut with ""Qaidi Band"" and his launch event was hosted by his cousin Ranbir Kapoor. In an interview with PTI, the actor says he is aware of the debate around nepotism and the negative comments his launch attracted. ""As a newcomer, who has always dreamt of becoming an actor, it was a huge deal for me to be introduced like that. I read the comments after the launch about nepotism. ""When you work so hard, give it all, an entire year of blood, sweat and hard work and then you read about these comments, you feel bad. I am human after all,"" Aadar says. But the 23-year-old actor does not want to get into the debate of whether he is talented or not. ""I dont want to say anything. Yes, I feel bad when people says things without seeing my work. I want my work to speak for itself. Thats the only thing I am here for."" However, Aadar does have an opinion about nepotism in the film industry. The youngster says someone belonging to a film family does get an easy opportunity to meet a director or a casting director but it does not guarantee a movie as an actor can only go forward on the basis of merit. ""The industry believes in talent. It doesnt matter what background you are from, you might be an outsider or from a film family, what matters is your talent. I had to audition for the film. ""I might come from a film family but that didnt guarantee me anything. At the end of the day I dont think a writer, director or producer will invest in a person who does not have the talent."" On the contrary, Aadar feels actors, who hail from film families, have to deal with the burden of expectations. Yash Raj Films ""Qaidi Band"" has been directed by Habib Faisal and will also serve as the launchpad for another newcomer, Anya Singh. The film is about seven under-trials, who form a musical band in the prison. The movie is a far-cry from the usual glamorous debut which newcomers often opt for but Aadar says he didnt think of it like that when he signed the project. ""I had not thought about it as an unconventional film and thats why I did it. This is a kind of film that I would like to watch. It is refreshing, new and a story not told before."" On his role as a prison inmate, Aadar says he had no real understanding of how to go about the role as his only references have been movies and TV shows like ""Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Prison Break"". ""I didnt know what actually happens inside a prison. That was very interesting for me especially the under-trial situation. That fascinated me. Those are the reasons why I wanted to do the film."" ""Qaidi Band"" releases on August 25. Aadars elder brother, Armaan Jain, made his debut in 2014 with ""Lekar Hum Deewana Dil"", which was a box office dud. The actor says Armaan has not taken a beating and will soon announce his second Bollywood venture. "

"According to police figures, over 1,500 children went missing in Delhi in the first five months of this year. ""As per the data, around 12 to 15 children are reported to be missing every day in Delhi,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajan Bhagat said. The police suspect human trafficking gangs behind the abduction of slum kids for cheap labour.","summarize: New Delhi, the capital has lived up to its fearful reputation of disappearing kids with over 1,500 children -- mostly between 6 and 15 -- reported missing in the first five months of this year, according to police figures.And only few are expected to return home, going by the past trends on tracing missing children.The latest data follows the disturbing trend of over a dozen children going missing in the capital each day and despite CCTV cameras and hi-tech aids, Delhi Police are finding it difficult to locate them.The success rate of Delhi Police is unimpressive, with a majority of the located children being those who return home on their own, according to crime record data.Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajan Bhagat said that the missing children mostly are in the age group of 6 and 15 and belong to economically weaker familes of downmarket areas of Delhi.""As per the data, around 12 to 15 children are reported to be missing every day in Delhi,"" Bhagat said.He said there was a possibility of the involvement of ""some inter-state human trafficking gangs"" who usually prowl the slum areas and abduct kids of ""deprived and migrants families"" for cheap labour.The capital has a bad record on account of missing children. As per government figures tabled in parliament during the budget session, nearly 27,000 children have gone missing in Delhi in the last five years and only 9,700 could be traced.Across the country, 30 per cent of the children remained untraceable, but in Delhi the number is the highest - 63 per cent.INITIATIVES LAUNCHED  Bhagat said police have launched a scheme, ""Pehchaan: Safeguarding the Childhood"", as part of its anti-human trafficking drive.Under the 'Pehchaan' initiative, children belonging to poor families residing in JJ clusters and resettlement colonies are being registered and photographed from time to time with the district police ""so that they can be traced if they happen to go missing in future"", Bhagat said.Bhagat said the ""situation is alarming"" in the capital and ""sometimes it is difficult to trace missing children since poor families do not even have photographs"" of their children.Thus beat constables have been tasked to capture photograph of all kids in slum areas, he said.""Under the 'Pehchaan' scheme, we also create awareness with the help of NGOs from time to time about crime rates with minors and juvenile in the capital. We educate parents on how to take care of their children.""HELP OF CYBER EXPERTS IN FINDING CHILDREN Sometimes police even take help of cyber-experts to trace those missing children who have access to cellphones and have social networking accounts.They are mostly aged 12-17 and such children leave their houses of their own volition. But sometimes they do access their social networking accounts and police cyber experts follow their IP addresses.But the number of such cases is minimal, a cyber expert officer said. Police also take help of NGOs as sometime children, who have been abducted and employed as domestic helps, get in touch with voluntary groups.These NGOs -- like ""Bachpan Bachao Andolan"" run by Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi -- play a crucial role in informing the police about exploitation of children.Satyarthi's group on May 18 rescued nine children -- aged between 7 and 15 -- from an illegal factory in old Delhi's Daryaganj area, where they were forced into slavery after being trafficked from Bihar.Also Read:Delhi's missing children: 12-15 kids disappear every day, 4 out of 10 never returnFree education upto class 12 for children of HIV positive patientsMissing children to be traced by face soonAlso Watch: "

"Delhi was officially announced as the capital of British Raj by the then-Emperor George V, on December 12, 1911. The capital was shifted from Calcutta as Delhi was the financial and political seat of many earlier empires and was located closer to the geographical center of India. The rising nationalist movement in Calcutta was also responsible for the shift.","summarize: It was on this day, 100 years ago, that an event changed the course of Delhi's history forever. The Delhi Durbar on December 12, 1911 was marked as a celebration of the coronation of King Emperor George V. Delhi had witnessed two such durbars before, in 1877 and 1903, but the Delhi Durbar of 1911 assumed unusual importance as King George V announced the shifting of British India's capital from Calcutta to Delhi.As chronicled by HT over the past year in the series New Delhi 100, Delhi in 1911 was just a small town in the Punjab province, still recovering from the wounds inflicted on it by the British regime after the uprising of 1857. But the king's proclamation at the durbar, kept a secret till then, changed Delhi's fate and put it firmly on the international political map.Calcutta, the nerve centre of British Raj till then, had fallen out of favour as it had become politically volatile. The British government wanted to shift the capital and Delhi won on many counts. It was closer to Shimla, the summer capital and was well connected by rail.In the next 20 years, New Delhi would be carved out of scattered villages and a rocky ridge inhabited by jackals. The new capital and its imposing buildings would come to define Delhi for the next 100 years. The capital, however, would keep growing beyond the garden city planned by Edwin Lutyens - and continues to grow."

"Accusing technology major Google of underpaying women, the US Department of Labor said that ""discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme"". The government department also alleged that Google violated employment laws in relation to salaries for its female employees. Earlier this month, Google had claimed to have closed the gender pay gap globally.","summarize: Google has discriminated against its female employees, according to the US Department of Labor (DoL), which said it had evidence of ?systemic compensation disparities?.As part of an ongoing DoL investigation, the government has collected information that suggests the internet search giant is violating federal employment laws with its salaries for women, agency officials said. ?We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,? Janette Wipper, a DoL regional director, testified in court in San Francisco on Friday.Reached for comment Friday afternoon, Janet Herold, regional solicitor for the DoL, said: ?The investigation is not complete, but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.?Herold added: ?The government?s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry.?Google strongly denied the accusations of inequities, claiming it did not have a gender pay gap.The explosive allegation against one of the largest and most powerful companies in Silicon Valley comes at a time when the male-dominated tech industry is facing increased scrutiny over gender discrimination, pay disparities and sexual harassment. The allegations emerged at a hearing in federal court as part of a lawsuit the DoL filed against Google in January, seeking to compel the company to provide salary data and documents to the government.Google is a federal contractor, which means it is required to allow the DoL to inspect and copy records and information about its its compliance with equal opportunity laws. Last year, the department?s office of federal contract compliance programs requested job and salary history for Google employees, along with names and contact information, as part of the compliance review.Google, however, repeatedly refused to hand over the data, which was a violation of its contractual obligations with the federal government, according to the DoL?s lawsuit. After the suit was originally filed, a company spokesperson claimed that Google had provided ?hundreds of thousands of records? to the government and that the requests outlined in the complaint were ?overbroad?, revealed confidential information, or violated employees? privacy. Labor officials detailed the government?s discrimination claims against Google at the Friday hearing while making the case for why the company should be forced to comply with the DoL?s requests for documents. Wipper said the department found pay disparities in a 2015 snapshot of salaries and said officials needed earlier compensation data to evaluate the root of the problem and needed to be able to confidentially interview employees. ?We want to understand what?s causing the disparity,? she said. Lisa Barnett Sween, one of Google?s attorneys, testified in opening remarks that the DoL?s request constituted a ?fishing expedition that has absolutely no relevance to the compliance review?. She said the request was an unconstitutional violation of the company?s fourth amendment right to protection from unreasonable searches.Marc Pilotin, a DoL attorney, said: ?For some reason or another, Google wants to hide the pay-related information.?In a statement to the Guardian, Google said: ?We vehemently disagree with [Wipper?s] claim. Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap. Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn?t provided any data, or shared its methodology.?The company has recently claimed that it has closed its gender pay gap globally and provides equal pay across races in the US. Herold told the Guardian that the department ?seeks additional information to ensure the accuracy of the department?s findings, because if the findings are confirmed, this is a troubling situation?.Google is not the first tech company to face legal action from the labor department over employment practices. In September, the DoL filed a lawsuit against Palantir, the Palo Alto data analytics company, alleging it systematically discriminated against Asian job applicants in its hiring process. Palantir has argued that the DoL?s analysis was flawed and the company has denied the accusations.In January, the department sued Oracle, another large tech company, claiming it paid white men more than others, leading to pay discrimination against women and black and Asian employees. Oracle claimed the case was ?politically motivated? and said its employment decisions were based on merit and experience.In recent months, there has been uncertainty about the future of these kinds of aggressive DoL enforcement efforts under Donald Trump. The president has rolled back Obama-era protections for female workers, and some DoL staffers have raised concerns that the new administration will not embrace the agency?s core mission of supporting workers? rights. An Oracle executive also joined Trump?s transition team, and the president?s close adviser Peter Thiel co-founded Palantir. In the Google case, the labor department?s lawyers have asked the court to cancel all of the company?s federal contracts and block any future business with the government if it continues to refuse to comply with the audit.Google began releasing diversity statistics in 2014 and reported last year that women made up 31% of its overall workforce and that only 2% of workers were black and 3% Latino. White employees accounted for 59% of the US workforce and Asians made up 32%.Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"

The decision has been taken following the directions of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

His view was that there are women who are impressed with party?s policies and ideology, but they don?t come out for different reasons. A special drive should be initiated to persuade them to join the party,? the leader said. Following Ram Lal?s instruction, state unit chief Manoj Tiwari has directed its Youth Wing (all 14 district presidents) to carry out an identification drive. ?The members of the Youth Wing have been asked to prepare a list of women in the age group of 18-25 years and are willing to work for the outfit. In the first phase, the district or block level leaders will prepare a list. Thereafter, a detailed strategy will be chalked out for further course of action. They are specifically been told that no pressure should be put on anyone, and to invite only those who are keen to join,? said a party insider. The BJP leaders, justifying the move, said the proposed cell will facilitate to tap a large section of the society, which generally remains ?unattended?. ?Female students mostly go to the Youth Wing and to work with the Mahila Morcha, one should be aged 25. Therefore, a significant number of women in the age group of 18-25 years are not actively involved in political activities. The party now plans to focus on this age group to strengthen the organisation further in the city,? he said."

The police, however, refuted the claim and said the engineer died in a suspected case of rash driving. According to the BSES spokesperson, three discom teams raided Jhul Jhuli village in Jaffarpur Kalan this afternoon following a tip-off about large-scale power theft in the area. The teams, accompanied by Delhi Police, came under attack and had to retreat, he said. ""The teams were chased by bike-borne goons. In the ensuing melee, one of the cars rammed a tree. Assistant engineer Abhimanyu Singh (32) was grievously injured. He later died,"" he said. A senior police officer said the BSES teams were provided adequate police force for the raid which went ""successfully"". ""Twenty six police personnel were accompanying the BSES teams. The anti power theft drive was successful. ""One of the cars met with an accident. No one was being chased as per initial reports,"" said the officer. A case has been registered in the matter, he said, adding the four injured BSES team members have been admitted to a hospital. In June this year, a Delhi Police sub-inspector and three BSES employees were injured in stone-pelting by locals during an anti-power theft drive in outer Delhi's Ranhola area. ISOLATED INCIDENTS ""These are not isolated incidents. Efforts of discom teams to check irregularities are often thwarted by law- defying people who function like organised gangs. Power theft has taken shape of an organised crime and active police support is needed to curb this menace,"" said the BSES spokesperson.

In the last five years, around 14,000 cases of power theft, having a connected load of around 33,000 KW, have been unearthed in the area, the spokesman added. Also Read:"

All six of them looked completely at home with this man whose face looked very familiar? but we could really recognise the man. It looked somewhat like Manish Makhija, aka Channel V?s Udham Singh, who made Hariyanvi cool much before Dangal happened. Manish, fondly known as Munna, was also Pooja Bhatt?s ex-husband. But it was unlikely that any star would have his ex-husband hanging around when she had called the media home. But then this was Pooja Bhatt, as unconventional and unorthodox as ever. The team goes and says hi to him and makes sure that he was indeed the man. But we were still hesitant to ask Pooja what her husband of 11 years, whom she had amicably broke up with three years back, is doing in her farmhouse. Sensing our curiosity she smiles and reveals that in fact they are still not legally separated! ?You know, we never really got divorced on paper!? WHAT? ?I don?t believe that a piece of paper can decide your relationship status. We made a choice to get married, to stay together, to end our marriage, and to remain friends.

"Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt participated in his first-ever mixed-gender relay, leading the 'Bolt All-Stars' team in the inaugural Nitro Athletics event in Melbourne on Saturday. Bolt raced in the mixed 4x100 metre relay, alongside compatriot Asafa Powell and Americans Jenna Prandini and Jeneba Tarmoh. ""I've never handed [a baton] over to a girl. For me that was exciting,"" said Bolt.","summarize: The Nitro Series promised to make athletics a show and the sport's ultimate show-man Usain Bolt capped its first meeting in Melbourne on Saturday by propelling his team of international ""All-Stars"" to a crowd-pleasing win in the 4x100 metres relay.Taking the baton from Olympic gold medal-winning team mate Asafa Powell, Jamaican Bolt powered down the second leg at Lakeside Stadium before Americans Jenna Prandini and Jeneba Tarmoh completed the win in the mixed team event ahead of Japan and Australia.Bolt's first run of the year and first in Australia brought the curtain down on opening night of the Series, which has pledged to ""revolutionise"" athletics with a team-based event that borrows heavily from the formula of sport and entertainment which has underpinned Twenty20 cricket's considerable success.With athletics struggling to maintain a profile outside of the Olympics and rocked by major doping and corruption scandals in recent years, organisers hope the series can reinvigorate the sport by shaking up the traditional schedule of events - and sprinkling some star-dust from marquee man Bolt.Bolt, who completed a ""treble treble"" of 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay Olympic titles at the 2016 Rio Games, was paid a seven-figure appearance fee to commit to all three meetings in the inaugural series in Melbourne this month and given a stake in the company running the event.He fulfilled his role as athletics' great entertainer, galloping on to the field before the meeting as flame cannons shot fireballs into the air and dancing to thumping pop music.""Tonight is the first night, we just want to do something different,"" Bolt told reporters as a crowd of hundreds of spectators craned necks to capture a glimpse.""I've never handed (a baton) over to a girl. For me that was exciting.""Everybody was having fun, everyone was trying to support their team mates.""Bolt's appearance helped secure a clutch of big names for the event, with American former Olympic 400m hurdles champion Kerron Clement running in his All-Stars team who won the overall event ahead of Australia.Christine Ohuruogu, the 2008 Olympic 400m champion, captained Team England.With mixed team events, a 2x300m relay and an elimination mile in which runners were knocked out progressively, the meeting carried on with troupes of dancers gyrating to electronic music in front of an enthusiastic crowd of about 7,000.SIMILAR SPECTACLEIt was a spectacle similar to any of the 'Big Bash' Twenty20 matches played at the nearby Melbourne Cricket Ground.But whereas Twenty20 competitions are underpinned by the support of dozens of high-profile players, Bolt carries a lot of the burden on his own shoulders.""It's not an understatement to say that we wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Usain Bolt and his management,"" Athletics Australia president Mark Arbib told Reuters before the meeting.""Usain Bolt and (agent) Ricky Simms have not just put their name to it, and are not just taking part, they have taken a stake in the business itself.""They've promoted it, selected the Bolt All-Star team, they've put their own IP (intellectual property) into the All-Stars, they're building a significant commercial asset.""Like a number of federations across the globe, Athletics Australia has battled to arrest declining crowds and interest in the sport, initially conceiving of the series as helping to boost the low profile of the nation's top athletes.But Bolt's signature had proven a ""game-changer"", Arbib, a former federal sports minister, said.It had secured a prime-time broadcast for a local athletics meeting for the first time in nearly a decade while attracting key corporate backers.Among them, Kerry Stokes, owner of the series' host broadcaster Seven West Media, had invested A$1 million ($768,000) of his own funds, the Australian Financial Review newspaper reported.The crowd was lower than the 8,500 stadium capacity but total tickets sold over the three nights of the series had comfortably outstripped those sold for the entire programme of national athletics events last year.If ambition was an Olympic sport, organisers could already crown themselves gold medal winners."

"Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has criticised the BJP-led Centre for not taking action against Karnataka government's ""offensive"" demand for a separate flag. He said it was part of BJP's plan to win the upcoming Karnataka assembly elections. The state government should also be slapped with sedition charges over the demand, he added.","summarize: For the first time after Shiv Sena almost lost its grip on its bastion of Mumbai in the civic polls earlier this year, party chief Uddhav Thackeray accepted that they didn?t fare as well as they expected.In the concluding part of this three-part interview in Sena?s mouthpiece Saamana, Thackeray said like everyone else even he believed that the Shiv Sena would win more than 100 of the 227 seats. He also blamed non-Marathi Hindus for the party?s low tally and said they rallied behind the BJP. After a bitter battle with the BJP, the Shiv Sena won 84 seats in the country?s richest municipal corporation and the BJP got 82. This was the first time in 25 years that any party had come so close to the Shiv Sena?s tally in Mumbai. In a discussion with Sena MP and executive editor of Saamana, Sanjay Raut, he said, ?In Mumbai?s case, the Marathi-speaking voters definitely stayed with the Shiv Sena. My party is really grateful to them.?He added, ?I just really feel bad about one thing. In 1992-93 riots in Mumbai did not spread as per civic wards. Wherever there was unrest, being Hindu the Shiv Sainiks saved every one by putting their lives at stake. I don?t think it is right to vote out those who have helped you in times of crisis.?Thackeray said several Shiv Sainiks are still battling criminal cases because they rushed to protect the Hindus of Mumbai and in return none of those expressed any gratitude to Shiv Sainiks. ?We don?t expect them to say thank you, but they should have remembered that it was Sena that saved them. Even today, I saved Mumbai?s octroi revenue from being washed out by the Goods and Services Tax. I didn?t do that only for the Marathi population in the city. I did it for the entire city,? Thackeray said.The Sena chief also hinted that mid-term polls in Maharashtra are unlikely despite increasingly choppy relations between the ruling parties. ?I don?t pay attention to empty threats from all over. BJP president Amit Shah visited Matoshree and clearly told me there won?t be any mid-term polls,? he said. Thackeray also criticised the Modi government, which Sena is a part of, for not taking a strict view of the Karnataka government?s ?offensive? demand for a separate flag. He also called for sedition charges to be slapped on the state. ?Unfortunately, I am the only one speaking out here. No one in other states or in the country is bothered. If I were to say the same thing about Maharashtra, people would have criticised us from all over.?"

Steven MorrisRichard Leese, the leader of Manchester city council, has spoken of the city?s determination to defeat terrorism. Speaking alongside Andy Burnham, Leese said:?Our thought are with the families and friends of the victims. As a city we will have to take some time to grieve. We have to ensure that terrorism never wins so business as usual as much as possible, communities coming together ? we will not allow this to divide us. As citizens of Manchester demonstrated last night, this city will pull together. A dark day but something that Manchester in its unique way will make sure we turn into a strength.

Matthew WeaverThe Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, was asked how the attack compared with the 7/7 attack in London in 2005. He said:I was in the Home Office as a minister on that day, and I remember how London felt on that day. I remember it very vividly. London pulled together in exactly the same way that Manchester is its own unique way will pull together. We will stand strong, and stand together, that?s what we are. That?s what we do. So they won?t win. We are grieving, we are hurt today, but as I said we are strong. And this city has dealt with difficult days in the past and we do so now.Burnham also confirmed that he would be taking part in the government?s emergency Cobra meeting via video-link from Manchester. He said: ?I will be heading over to Greater Manchester police force headquarters after this press call to take part in the Cobra meeting alongside the police constable. There will be a further update after that.

Elle HuntFor some it sounded muffled and far away, as though somewhere in the distance a big balloon had popped. For others the terror was all too immediately apparent.The lights had just come on and Ariana Grande had left the stage after concluding an elaborate three-hour, four-part entertainment extravaganza with an encore performance of her latest single, Dangerous Woman.At 10.30pm following a sold-out show in the 21,000-capacity Manchester Arena, thousands of fans began to gather up their belongings and filter slowly out of four exits.Then the bang.For the first milliseconds, minds did not immediately connect the sound with an explosion or a bomb.?It sounded like a big balloon popping, but it was kind of muffled, like it wasn?t in the stadium itself,? said a young Mancunian fan, identified as Sammy, in a video he recorded of his experience and posted on Periscope.?There were a few screams, then there was silence. Then the whole arena literally split like the Red Sea ? everyone was trampling over each other, sprinting to get to the nearest exit. It was like a scene out of a horror movie.?"
"India have played the ICC Champions Trophy in all the previous seven editions and won the tournament in 2013, while finishing as joint-winners with Sri Lanka in 2002. India had won the 2013 edition without dropping a single match. The 2017 edition will be the first major ICC tournament for Virat Kohli as the captain of the Indian team.","summarize: India have had pretty mixed fortunes at the ICC Champions Trophy. India have played the tournament in all the previous seven editions finishing on top twice while ending runners-up once.Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and most lately Shikhar Dhawan have been key to India's rise at the multi-nation tournament. Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and Ishant Sharma have been the among the top wicket-takers at the event while MS Dhoni is the most successful Indian wicket-keeper. This time they will go into the tournament as defending champions and would look to create history by becoming the first team to win the championship thrice.Here's a look at India's journey at the top ICC event:1998 Wills International Cups (Bangladesh) - SEMI-FINALSIndia fielded a strong side with Mohammad Azharuddin as captain. The side boasted of a strong batting line-up with the likes of Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Ajay Jadeja and Robin Singh in the side. Javagal Srinath spearheading the pace attack while Anil Kumble looked after the spin department.However,India were knocked out in semi-finals by West Indies, who were led by Brian Lara.2000 ICC KnockOut (Kenya) - RUNNERS-UPSourav Ganguly's 117 went in vain in the big final as Chris Cairns' 102 not out guided New Zealand to a four-wicket win to hand Kiwis the trophy. Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan made their debuts for India in the tournament.2002 ICC Champions Tropy (Sri Lanka) - CHAMPIONS (Shared)India, under Sourav Ganguly, went a step further by becoming the joint champions with Sri Lanka after the final was rained-off twice. In the final, Sri Lanka posted 244/5 with Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara scoring a fifty each. In reply, India started off well and were 14/0 in two overs when rain halted the proceedings and no further play was possible that day.On the reserve day, Sri Lanka again won the toss and batted first. This time Mahela Jayawardene and Russell Arnold struck fifties to help Sri Lanka post 222/7 in their 50 overs. In response, Virender Sehwag looked at his menacing best with 25 not out off 22 balls when heavy rain stopped play. Once again the persistent rain denied a result and the trophy was awarded to both Sri Lanka and India.2004 ICC Champions Trophy (England) - GROUP STAGEIndia failed to go beyond the group stage. India started off their campaign with a thunderous 98-run win over Kenya but a three-wicket defeat against Pakistan was enough to stop Ganguly's men from advancing to the semi-finals.2006 ICC Champions Trophy (India) - GROUP STAGEIndia's batting line-up failed to fire in the big tournament at home. They managed to beat England in their first game but their star-studded batting continued to misfire and consecutive defeats against West Indies and Australia left them with just one win in the tournament.2009 ICC Champions Trophy (South Africa) - GROUP STAGEIndia again failed to impress. Rahul Dravid-led side started with a 54-run loss against Pakistan while their next game against Australia yielded no result because of rain. In their third group match, India beat West Indies to finish with three points in the table but it was not enough to get them through to the semi-finals."

Mind you, it could be worse... For one thing, South Africa could have had AB de Villiers, Dale Steyn and Kagiso Rabada in their ranks. For another, they could have held one of those early chances offered by Joe Root at Lord?s, in which case they might well be 2-0 up with two to play. An email from Andrew Benton. ?The next Test will be the measure of Root?s captaincy. Can he make the changes necessary, and/or inspire the team? We should give him the series, only then can we pass judgement.? And even that might be a bit premature. I can?t see him losing the job before the Ashes, can you?

It?s an ill wind etc etc, as shown by this email from Smylers. ?An upside of England managing to lose this Test inside four days is that tomorrow?s England Women?s World Cup semi-final against South Africa will now be live on the radio.

England only have four problem areas. First, the top order: they?re all left-handers, they?re all crabby, and with Alastair Cook?s form fading, they all struggle to deal with the stock Test-match delivery. In 12 innings, Cook, Keaton Jennings and Gary Ballance have made 246 at an average of 20, which is one shaky set of foundations. Second, Mark Wood. The quickest of England?s bowlers has also been the least incisive: he has one for 197 off 56 overs. Chris Woakes?s recovery from injury cannot come too soon.Third, Liam Dawson. A resourceful cricketer who bowled one great ball to dismiss Amla at Lord?s, Dawson is summed up by one stat: in his whole career, he has taken five wickets in a first-class innings three times. The equivalent figure for Adil Rashid is 19. As a pair, Rashid and Moeen Ali may be expensive, but at least they are penetrating. Dawson is not. He is a bits-and-pieces player who is not even making runs.Fourth, the balance of the side. The batting order is more like a disorder ? too quiet at first, then too noisy, with three blockers followed by Root and four dashers. The selectors can be faulted for two things: preferring Dawson to Rashid, and picking only four specialist batsmen ? two of whom, Jennings and Ballance, are now walking wickets.Updated

On a day like this, we?re all armchair selectors. And some wise heads are already gathering for the meeting...Jeremy Smith: ?The reality is that England?s best number three is still Jonathan Trott, a 36-year-old who retired from international cricket two years ago on health grounds.?Zia Faruqui: ?Are Buttler or Morgan really the solution? Surely both play in the same single devil-may-care mode as the current incumbents? Need Hameed back.?Neil Virani: ?I?m quite amazed by people calling for Test players based on ODI performances. This match and several before are an indictment of employing a Test coach based on his short-form record. Bayliss seems to think every Test pitch is 500 par and every ODI pitch 350 par, and refuses to tell his team to adapt to the conditions.?Ashley Roberts: ?We need to talk about Bayliss. He has been in the job for a few years now but I?m struggling to see how he has improved this Test team. England have batted appallingly in this match, but I think they are a lot more talented than this, which begs the question: why are they all giving their wickets away? Shouldn?t the coach have some influence over that and their type of play? We are seeing these England collapses time and again under Bayliss and, while the players have to accept responsibility, so does he.?Updated

A sharp point from the tireless John Starbuck. ?Du Plessis now has only two Tests to knock the England captain from his perch. It must be a standard Saffer objective now. ?Still,? he adds, ?Trent Bridge lived up to its reputation as another three-day Test ground. You?ve got to laugh.?

3.09pm BST

So England were awful, but isn?t this great for the series? There is nothing worse than back-to-back Tests producing an instant 2-0, especially when there are only two Tests to come. The series has ebbed and flowed already, which is the life-blood of Test cricket. There?s now a week off, and a chance for England to regroup.

3.06pm BST
15:06

The first thing to say is not that England were awful, but South Africa were vastly improved. They bowled well, batted resolutely, fielded smartly, and above all they were well led. My colleague Rob Smyth reckons the man of the match should be Faf du Plessis, on the John Abrahams principle, and although it?s unlikely to happen, it may well be right. He came on stage as a very modern version of a deus ex machina: the captain returning from paternity leave. At Lord?s, Joe Root faced another novice at the toss; here, he faced a battle-hardened pro.Updated

44th over: England 133-8 (Dawson 5, Wood 0) And so the dismal procession continues.Our latest selector, ready to do a bit better than the real ones, is Anthony Hulse. ?Picking up on the earlier discussion, it?s difficult to see what there is to lose by playing either of Morgan or Buttler. As has been pointed out, at least they have demonstrated the ability to get runs against international bowling attacks, under the sort of pressure which playing international sport brings. With modern run rates and batting approaches who?s to say there isn?t overall more in common between ODIs and Tests than there is between Tests and county cricket? I?m sure both of them are probably better at keeping out straight deliveries on a length than Gary Ballance is, although that?s not a desperately high bar to clear.?

38th over: England 120-5 (Stokes 17, Ali 25) A rare quiet over for South Africa, Maharaj struggling manfully to stem the flow of runs ... then, after just a single ceded from the over, Moeen drives its final ball, Morkel keels over but can?t stop it properly, and after some tricklage, England add four more. I?ve been sent a fair few messages checking that i was joking about Buttler and solidity - I can confirm that I was. ?You can never be too sure these days; apparently Liam Dawson as a frontline spinner is deadly serious,? snarks Miles Dilworth. However, I would like to see Buttler given another go in Tests, and think the true tracks in Australia will suit him. 

2.18pm BST

37th over: England 115-5 (Stokes 16, Ali 21) Morkel squares Moeen up, only for Moeen to edge and see the ball race away for four. So Moeen restores the karmic balance, going back then leaning forward to drive on the up through extra cover - that?s a lovely shot, and it brings four. I smell a bouncer - and Moeen will too, I shouldn?t wonder. Here?s an email from Graham, harking back to the OBO community of yore: ?Given that England are bound to lose this match before close of play, perhaps now would be a good time to give a shout out to Krakow Cricket Club.

34th over: England 93-5 (Stokes 15, Ali 0) Stokes eases a drive past the dive of mid-off for four, so Maharaj tries a flatter, quicker one - he looks a fine, intelligent bowler I must say. But Stokes then stretches out to him, gets down on one knee, and flip-sweeps him around the corner for another four. England are stepping on the gas now.

32nd over: England 84-5 (Stokes 6, Ali 0) Maharaj races through a taxing maiden; the fifth ball seems to catch an edge and fly up to the vacant backward short leg. A replay shows that it came off the pad, but a man is inserted there nonetheless.

Anyway, Morkel directs a vicious, spitting bouncer towards Stokes? throat, rattling the glove of his top hand as he fences.

It?s retro day again! Welcome to the 90s!

13:47

29th over: England 83-4 (Bairstow 16, Stokes 5) Morkel takes the ball and rams one into Bairstow?s thigh-pad. Bairstow then follows one around his pads, but can?t quite apply the edge that will send him on his merry way. Instead, he flicks the final delivery for four through midwicket. ?Root?s dislike of Rashid isn?t personal,? reassures John Starbuck, ?it?s because he?s prejudiced against wrist-spinners, who leak more runs but take more wickets than the offies. As a batsman himself, the prospect of having to score more is unwelcome.?I?m not sure about that - I?d imagine he might also consider who and what he?d fancy facing. Maybe he doesn?t deem Rashid?s risk worth the potential reward, but if the batsmen do their job properly they can afford a luxury leg-spinner.

A couple of years ago, I wondered if England should bring Eoin Morgan back into the Test side...Eoin Morgan needs another go in the Test team. Discuss.Not everyone agreed.

?On the Rashid/Root suggestion,? says Ian Truman, ?I?d be interested just how much Root has played with Rashid over the last 5 years, I?d suggest he?s played with him more for the England ODI side (where we?d all agree Rashid has been pretty decent) than he has for Yorkshire. It just seems so odd given that Rashid is a good batsman in his own right as well.?He?s played Tests with him too - presumably he didn?t like what he saw. Which isn?t to say that i get it.

?Well, this is going well,? says Guy Hornsby of

Brexit
 our proceedings. There was a really good stat on Channel 5 on the weekend showing how little England have bowled on the stumps. Now, I know that this doesn?t necessarily translate to wanting to nick batsmen off when shaping away, but surely Philander?s proved ? like McGrath before him ? that there?s simple value in making the batsman play. It?s death by a thousand cuts, as Atherton, Hussain et al will tell you when it came to the Ashes. Tall bowlers are all well and good but if you?ll never hit the stumps, where?s the pressure? Someone pass me the gin.?Agree with a lot of this, but Morkel has been great so far this series. The difference in this match - in mine - has been the batting more than the bowling. 

1.30pm BST

28th over: England 79-4 (Bairstow 12, Stokes 5) Maharaj will bowl the final over before lunch, and he?s another who?s risen to the occasion - not just here, but at Lord?s. Bairstow uses his feet to take a single into the off side, which means three balls into the rough at Stokes - close by are two silly points. Stokes, though defends well enough, and thus ends another fantastic session for South Africa. Updated

27th over: England 78-4 (Bairstow 11, Stokes 5) Stokes allows Martin to hit his face, running the ball through third man for four and reducing the target fro 400 and something to a far more manageable 300 and something. This is a fine spell from Morris, just when England might?ve thought themselves relative safe - his performance does not show Mark Wood in a favourable light. So, who comes in and who goes out for the Oval? I guess I?d keep Wood and Jennings but bin Dawson and Ballance. 

12.54pm BST
12:54

26th over: England 74-4 (Bairstow 11, Stokes 1) Bairstow adds one with a sweep and then Stokes props forward tentatively, imparting an edge which cues strangulated shouts. Nasser points out that Stokes? gloves are very low, inviting the ball to run up them for a catch when he should be booting it away. Silly point comes in, and a shove towards mid on averts the additional embarrassment of a pair.  ?Not so long ago that Bairstow and Stokes added 399 against South Africa,? emails Peter Salmon; some of you might remember that he is in the pub. I?m not sure he?ll be getting served too many more.

12.49pm BST
12:49

25th over: England 72-4 (Bairstow 10, Stokes 0) Du Plessis has had a brilliant game here, from the moment he called correctly and was ballsy enough to bat. That bouncer was part of a plan he communicated to Morris last over, though the bowler did well to hold it back initially, then bowl it as quickly as he did. Wicket maiden. 

12.46pm BST

Well done South Africa! They decide to go short at Cook, who opts to take it on. Then at the last second he tries to pull out, by which time the ball is in front of his helmet - it?s brilliantly straight. Cook succeeds only in swatting it down the leg side, where De Kock takes a superb catch. Expect England?s demise to accelerate from here. Updated

24th over: England 72-3 (Cook 42, Bairstow 10) Bairstow twists one away against the spin, and it zooms for four through square-leg. Then, though, spooked by that one which flew in Maharaj?s last over, Bairstow presses forward tentatively and inside-edges onto his pad. That did not look secure, but it did the trick.

23rd over: England 68-3 (Cook 42, Bairstow 6) Root is now inside the dressing room and looking glum; on the bright side, perhaps Cook is playing his way into Test form, and as non-captain. Tangentially, where do we stand on the name Faf? Does it accord pleasing notoriety, or the further nickname Bum? Maiden.

22nd over: England 68-3 (Cook 42, Bairstow 6) When at the cricket, is it acceptable to drink fizz out of a pint glass? Asking for a friend, though at Lord?s last summer the kid in front cut out the middle man and just used the bottle. Maharaj is on and the ball is spinning, but without many close catchers; his final delivery pitches middle and leg, then pitches right across Bairstow! Dearie me! ?I prefer Rashid to Dawson too, but do find it telling that Root, who knows him well, would rather do without, emails Mark Gillespie, quoting me back to myself.?1. How do we know, or why do we assume, that Root is the sole arbiter of who plays and doesn?t? I always had the impression that the team selection was a joint effort between selectors, captain and coach, with the selectors having the biggest say.2. Is the reality not that it?s Moeen, not Dawson, who?s been picked over Rashid? My thinking behind that being that the balance of the team was meant to be a ?control? spinner plus a wicket taking spinner, and that neither Moeen nor Rashid could fulfill the former role? I?m clearly not suggesting that?s worked, by the way, but potentially that was the theory.?I?d say that in the end, the captain gets what he wants, because he?s the one taking the players onto the pitch and it?s pointless giving him a bowler he?d rather not bring on. Moeen is in the team for his batting anyway, no?

21st over: England 66-3 (Cook 41, Bairstow 5) Morris races in and Cook whacks him to square-leg - there?s a man there, so they only run one. On the balcony, Root looks pensive; he?s probably not found much difficult in his life, but here we are. Anyway, Bairstow adds a further single.

20th over: England 64-3 (Cook 40, Bairstow 4) Cook plays for Olivier?s outswing, driving through cover; WinViz says South Africa are 100% likely to win this match. Cook takes a single and the field is pretty spread for Bairstow; that?s a little strange, given his score of 0 and the 406 more runs England need. Anyway, the first of those issues is quickly resolved via four down the ground. ?I?m not for dropping Ballance,? emails Gareth Fitzgerlad. You just know Andy Flower will demand James Vince get another chance...That being said ? why does Dawson need to be replaced by a spinner? Do we need four seamers and two spinners??I agree that six bowlers are too many, but just can?t see how Ballance is a Test number 3, nor why we need to expend more time investigating. Updated

19th over: England 55-3 (Cook 35, Bairstow 0) There was nothing Root could?ve done about that ball - the tardiness of the swing meant that the shot he played was redundant. And the effect will not just be removing Root, but instilling fear into those who come after. As Phil Leotardo once said, ?Decapitate and we do business with whatever?s left.?Updated

18th over: England 55-2 (Cook 35, Root 8) Things have quietened down out in the middle; England daren?t give anything away in this period. Presumably Maharaj will be on soon, and that will be the next test; in the meantime, Root turns away a single and Cook escapes by missing a pull entirely, while Holding complains that there are too many fielders saving runs and too few catchers. Cook rams the point home by edging four, in the air, to close the over. Updated

17th over: England 50-2 (Cook 31, Root 7) Cook has never scored more than 50 at Trent Bridge; you?d back him to beat that now. Morris is on, bowling to two slips and gully - ?that looks a bit meagre to me,? says Mikey, far more melodically than I can type. root takes a single off the final ball of the over, playing it down into the off side and haring away. ?I think that bowling replacements are better,? emails Matthew Doherty, replying to Neil Harris. ?Rashid and Roland-Jones, with Woakes to return.?I prefer Rashid to Dawson too, but do find it telling that Root, who knows him well, wold rather do without. Roland-Jones is an unknown quantity - we cannot be sure he?ll come in and do the necessary, nor that he?s more likely to than Wood is to improve - and Woakes is out for the series. Updated

16th over: England 49-2 (Cook 31, Root 6) Philander is done for the now, and Olivier has the ball; he?s full and straight first up, so Root drives three to long-off; Philander has to chase to the fence. Small victories, people, small victories. Meanwhile, back in the middle, Olivier gives Cook one on his pads - you know the rest. Or, to put it another way, the next phase of the innings is upon us, and England daren?t lose another wicket. So they add four more instead, Cook onto the front foot to drive down the ground. He is in, and that?s drinks. Updated

15th over: England 38-2 (Cook 23, Root 3) Third slip is so close as to be wearing a helmet but Root is yet to require his services, presenting the face to run three through mid-off. A good omen: his bat is New Balance - if only, etcetera - which connotes One Bryan Robson, the original Captain Marvel. Sorry, that?s all I?ve got; I take no responsibility for any dislocating shoulder.?How many changes is too many? asks Neil Harris. ?I reckon four are in serious danger of not playing the next test ? Jennings, Ballance, Dawson and Wood. Cannot think of a case for keeping any of them.?I can think of one very pertinent one: lack of obvious replacements. Updated

Philander has bowled 6.3 overs, of which 33 deliveries have landed in line with the stumps; he now has the best average of any bowler with 50 or more Test wickets. Cook then waves slightly away from his body, but makes decent enough contact, earning four to third man before tucking a couple off his hip. Huge over for England, six from it. Updated

Root defends confidently and grins at Morkel; ?what are you looking at, butthead,? comes back the reply. Next ball, Root edges, but with soft hands, such that it drops short of second slip; just imagine his bedroom sensitivity.

It has formed an 80-member team of enforcement officials who in just five days have prosecuted 1,296 such drivers. The officials, dressed in plain clothes, have been deployed at bus stops like Dhaula Kuan, ITO, AIIMS, Mukarba Chowk, Peeragarhi, Laxmi Nagar and INA.?From July 10 to 15, we have taken action against 393 drivers of DTC, 454 drivers of the cluster or orange bus service and 449 of metro feeder buses and gramin sewas,? the official added.

The state Anti Terror Squad (ATS) and Inspector General of Police (IGP) Aseem Arun confirmed the recovery and added that primary inquiry suggested the packet contained magnesium sulphate and would be sent for the forensic examination. He said the magnesium sulphate is used as drying agent for packing material. Arun said pan masala and other eatables packets are usually thrown inside the premises and that anti-mine, anti-sabotage and bomb disposal squads were sanitising every corner of the Vidhan Bhawan premises. On July 12, the recovery of PETN powder weighing around 150 grams below the chair?s cushion in the arena where legislators sit during the assembly session triggered panic. Sleuths initially believed the PETN was simple powder and sent it for forensic examination at State Forensic Science Laboratory in Mahanagar, Lucknow. The alert was sounded after the forensic experts confirmed it as high-potential explosive on Friday. A PETN sample however is also been sent to explosive unit of Agra forensic science laboratory for check its purity level.

By formally requesting consultations with the three countries, Qatar has triggered a 60-day deadline for them to settle the complaint or face litigation at the WTO and potential retaliatory trade sanctions.","summarize: Qatar filed a wide-ranging legal complaint at the World Trade Organization on Monday to challenge a trade boycott by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and United Arab Emirates, the director of Qatar?s WTO office Ali Alwaleed al-Thani told Reuters.By formally ?requesting consultations? with the three countries, the first step in a trade dispute, Qatar triggered a 60 day deadline for them to settle the complaint or face litigation at the WTO and potential retaliatory trade sanctions.?We?ve given sufficient time to hear the legal explanations on how these measures are in compliance with their commitments, to no satisfactory result,? al-Thani said.?We have always called for dialogue, for negotiations, and this is part of our strategy to talk to the members concerned and to gain more information on these measures, the legality of these measures, and to find a solution to resolve the dispute.?The boycotting states cut ties with Qatar - a major global gas supplier and host to the biggest US military base in the Middle East - on June 5, accusing it of financing militant groups in Syria, and allying with Iran, their regional foe, allegations Doha denies.The boycotting countries have previously told the WTO that they would cite national security to justify their actions against Qatar, using a controversial and almost unprecedented exemption allowed under the WTO rules.They said on Sunday they were ready for talks to tackle the dispute, the worst rift between Gulf Arab states in years, if Doha showed willingness to deal with their demands.The text of Qatar?s WTO complaint cites ?coercive attempts at economic isolation? and spells out how they are impeding Qatar?s rights in the trade in goods, trade in services and intellectual property.The complaints against Saudi Arabia and the UAE run to eight pages each, while the document on Bahrain is six pages.There was no immediate reaction from the three to Qatar?s complaint, which is likely to be circulated at the WTO later this week.?REMAIN HOPEFUL?The disputed trade restrictions include bans on trade through Qatar?s ports and travel by Qatari citizens, blockages of Qatari digital services and websites, closure of maritime borders and prohibition of flights operated by Qatari aircraft.The complaint does not put a value on the trade boycott, and al-Thani declined to estimate how much Qatar could seek in sanctions if the litigation ever reached that stage, which can take 2-5 years or longer in the WTO system.?We remain hopeful that the consultations could bear fruit in resolving this,? he said.The WTO suit does not include Egypt, the fourth country involved in the boycott. Although it has also cut travel and diplomatic ties with Qatar, Egypt did not expel Qatari citizens or ask Egyptians to leave Qatar.Al-Thani declined to explain why Egypt was not included.?Obviously all options are available. But we have not raised a consultation request with Egypt yet,? he said.In its WTO case, Qatar would also draw attention to the impact the boycott was having on other WTO members, he added.Many trade diplomats say that using national security as a defence risks weakening the WTO by removing a taboo that could enable countries to escape international trade obligations.Al-Thani said governments had wide discretion to invoke the national security defence but it had to be subject to oversight.?If it is self-regulating, that is a danger to the entire multilateral trading system itself. And we believe the WTO will take that into consideration.?Qatar also raised the boycott at a meeting of the United Nations? International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on Monday, al-Thani said.In comments to Qatar-based Al Jazeera television later on Monday, Qatar?s transport and information minister said the boycotting countries had discriminated against Doha in violation of an international agreement guaranteeing overflights.?These countries have used this right arbitrarily and imposed it on aircraft registered only in the State of Qatar,? Jassim bin Saif al-Sulaiti said.Qatar in June asked Montreal-based ICAO to resolve the conflict, using a dispute resolution mechanism in the Chicago Convention, a 1944 treaty that created the agency and set basic rules for international aviation.Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain said on Sunday they would allow Qatari planes to use air corridors in emergencies.

"Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui has said that initially he felt he was forced to dance but started enjoying dancing while doing the film Munna Michael, which stars Tiger Shroff.

When asked how it was to dance on screen, Nawazuddin told reporters, ""Initially I felt I was forced to do it, but I started enjoying dancing while doing the film... Dance is a passion just like acting. Its God gift to people. But I am not one of the gifted ones."" The actor was speaking at the trailer launch of the film. Tiger, who was also present at the event, quickly added, ""If he starts dancing too, humara kaam mushkil ho jayega (our jobs would be difficult). I dont think we will be able to perform as good as Nawaz sir. He is just a holistic actor. After watching the film his fans will be surprised."" Nawazuddin, 43, said he has tried to match up the dancing skills of Tiger. ""I cant be a dancing hero, but if I get a solo hero film Ill definitely do it but it shouldnt have dancing.

Lap 69/70 Mercedes haven?t been able to swap Hamilton and Bottas back, an unlikely bonus for the Briton and his championship hopes.

2.40pm BST
14:40

Lap 68/70 Vettel is closing in on another grand prix victory and 25 valuable championship points. He had a worry with those steering issues earlier and put his team-mate under pressure in the process, but they are nearing a crucial Ferrari one-two. 

2.39pm BST
14:39

Lap 67/70 McLaren, by the way, are on the verge of sealing sixth and 10th positions, a very good result. Alonso has clear air and he?s enjoying himself, setting one of the fastest laps of the race. Updated

2.37pm BST
14:37

Lap 66/70 Mercedes are now the ones with a decision to make. They had promised Bottas they would return him to third, after he let Hamilton through earlier. But there is a gap of five seconds between them and Verstappen is flying up behind in the Red Bull. It?s been some race from the Dutch driver considering his ten-second penalty. 

2.34pm BST
14:34

Lap 64/70 ?We?re going to have to retire the car,? Paul di Resta is told. That?s a shame for Felipe Massa?s stand-in who had been enjoying a steady race in his first taste of the Williams car. 

2.33pm BST
14:33

Lap 63/70 Magnussen jams past Hulkenberg and Kvyat aggressively and up to 11th as he chases a championship point. Vettel has opened up a slightly wider gap, now around two seconds. He seems to be over whatever he was struggling with through the middle part of this race.

2.30pm BST
14:30

Lap 61/70 Vettel continues to muddle on, but the turbulent air he?s kicking up is preventing Raikkonen from successfully closing the gap. Hamilton is suffering the same issue, it seems. He tells Mercedes he is waiting for a mistake. The top ten:1 Vettel 2 Raikkonen +1.53 Hamilton +1.04 Bottas +5.35 Verstappen +3.56 Alonso +53.27 Sainz +6.38 Perez +1.49 Ocon +4.310 Vandoorne +4.1

Lap 58/70 What a situation Ferrari have got themselves into as we approach the final 12 laps. Vettel, Raikkonen and Hamilton remain only two seconds apart. Raikkonen has stepped off a little, conscious that he is going to wear out his tyres if he keeps trying to close down his team-mate. Hamilton is struggling to get any closer to the Ferraris, though, despite the aid of DRS. 

2.23pm BST
14:23

Lap 55/70 The Ferraris are approaching the backmarkers of Magnussen and Hulkenberg, who themselves are scrapping for 11th. They move through the traffic in one of the trickiest parts of the track, the third and final sector approaching the long pitstraight. As Vettel crosses the line he?s only 0.7 seconds ahead of Raikkonen, who is 0.7 seconds up on Hamilton. Bottas can?t keep up right now. 

2.20pm BST
14:20

Lap 53/70 Hamilton is chasing Raikkonen, but the Fin is lining up a pass of his own as he attacks Vettel, who continues to struggle a little. He?s within DRS range and these two Ferraris are running round the Hungaroring in close convoy. 

2.17pm BST

2.15pm BST
14:15

Lap 49/70 Hulkenberg is having a terrible pit stop. Smoke appears to be billowing from his front left tyre, and as he pulls away he seems very unsure of whether his car is still road-worthy. Up ahead, Hamilton is attacking Raikkonen ? he?s 1.1 seconds down. Raikkonen is 1.1 seconds behind Vettel as it bunches up at the front. Raikkonen is continuing to complain on radio that he should be allowed to pass his team-mate. ?Vettel is being told to push, stay with him,? respond Ferrari. 

2.11pm BST
14:11

Lap 47/70 Mercedes give the order and Valtteri Bottas pulls wide to allow Hamilton to pass. He sets his sights on Raikkonen and puts the hammer down, immediately setting an absurd fastest first sector.

Lap 45/70 Lewis Hamilton on radio to Mercedes, in teenager mode. ?OK man, look, I?ve got a lot of pace. Let me use it. And this radio stuff sucks, my tyres were fine. I didn?t need to come in.?

Lap 43/70 Max Verstappen comes in, serves his 10-second penalty, puts on some fresh shoes and shuffles back out in fifth position behind the Ferraris and Mercedes.

2.04pm BST
14:04

Lap 41/70 An interesting situation has developed at the front. Vettel is struggling and behind him Raikkonen is putting in quick times. Raikkonen wants to be let through to have a go at winning this race, but Vettel is their only championship hope and they don?t want to leave him vulnerable to the two Mercedes chasing. Ferrari HQ has a major decision to make. Updated

2.00pm BST
14:00

Lap 39/70 Verstappen, the only one of the initial top six not to have stopped, is actually leading this race by 10.6 seconds, so even his 10-second time penalty can?t take that away from him. He?ll be in shortly. 

1.58pm BST
13:58

Lap 37/70 Sergio Perez brings that garish Force India into the pits but it?s a pretty poor one and he?s lost some time. Next Alonso is in. He is desperate to get in and out ahead of Sainz, almost colliding with his young Spanish counterpart on exit. A battle ensues as they emerge on to the circuit but Sainz holds on to ninth spot, Alonso running off and on again in his eagerness to pass. 

1.54pm BST
13:54

Lap 34/70 Vettel?s pit stop is a little sluggish. Next comes Raikkonen. First he sounds off over radio, telling backmarker Paul di Resta to ?get back in the commentary box?. He stops, comes out and nearly holds off his Ferrari team-mate, but not quite. Updated

1.51pm BST
13:51

Lap 32/70 ?Fronts are not in a healthy shape,? says Vettel. ?Don?t extend it.? He wants to come in. Hamilton does stop and Mercedes get through it nearly a second quicker than his team-mate?s change of tyres. He returns fifth, such was the huge gap to Carlos Sainz before he came in. 

1.49pm BST
13:49

Lap 31/70 Despite the issue with his steering wheel, Vettel seems comfortable enough to continue leading the way, though Raikkonen has closed that gap down from nearly two seconds. Now the stops start: Bottas comes in for Mercedes, a slightly slow one. Updated

13:44

Lap 27/70 We are heading towards the part of the race when we should see a flurry of stops. The supersoft tyre (which most drivers have started with) is significantly quicker than the soft around the Hungaroring, though it doesn?t last nearly as long. There could well be some undercut opportunities here. Meanwhile: ?The steering is hanging to the left when I go straight,? complains Sebastian Vettel. ?And I think it?s getting worse.?

1.40pm BST

Lap 23/70 Well it should have been a long stint. ?OK slow down, bring it back,? Haas say on radio. ?I think we have a crossed wheel nut.?

Lap 17/70 Here?s a huffy Daniel Ricciardo, who doesn?t hold back with his thoughts on Max Verstappen?s opening lap: ?It was what it was. I saw I had a good run out of one, I thought I?ll just go here and protect that place, and felt it hit. For sure it?s not on, that was amateur to say the least. I don?t think he likes when a team-mate gets in front of him. It was a very poor mistake. For sure, we?ll sort it out. I don?t think there?s an excuse for it. He got the line taken away from, he sees me go past, and it?s like ?I?ve got to fix this? and that?s it.?

1.26pm BST
13:26

Lap 14/70 Grosjean and Hulkenberg?s bump, a moment I haven?t seen much of, has been dismissed by the stewards as a racing incident. Yellow flags are out again briefly in sector one but are back in their holsters almost immediately. Vettel?s lead is already up to 3.4secs, but the biggest gap in the top six is between Raikkonen in second and Bottas in third of 5.6secs.

Lap 12/70 Clears signs of degradation on Lewis Hamilton?s rear tyres, but his priority at the moment is communication with Mercedes who are having some system issues in the garage ? though soon enough they get in touch to say it?s fixed. ?Good to have you back,? says Hamilton. 

1.21pm BST
13:21

Lap 7/70 Fantastic battling between Perez, Alonso and Sainz with the latter jumping past the former world champion and up to sixth, one place behind Hamilton. Back in the paddock, Ricciardo is watching a replay, his famous grin nowhere to be seen. 

1.14pm BST
13:14

Lap 6/70 That Verstappen lock up was unfortunate but Ricciardo will still be fuming that his team-mate took such an aggressive line. The safety car comes in, and Vettel zips away with Raikkonen on his tail. Hamilton attacks Verstappen and they?re wheel to wheel through the first few corners, but the teenager won?t yield!

1.11pm BST
13:11

Lap 4/70 The safety car is out and leading Vettel round the Hungaroring, followed by Raikkonen, Bottas, Verstappen, Hamilton, Sainz, Alonso, Perez, Vandoorne, and Ocon in 10th.

13:09

Lap 2/70 Yellow flags as Ricciardo?s car is dealt with. The replay shows Hamilton try to hold the inside line on the tight turn one and get swamped by both Red Bulls, but on turn two Verstappen seems to lock up slightly, slamming into the side of his team-mate. A moment later Ricciardo is spinning across the track, and very fortunate not to take a big hit as he spun. Updated

After his dominance of Silverstone, Saturday was supposed to be the moment Lewis Hamilton equalled Michael Schumacher?s record of 68 poles, which had stood untouched for 11 years. Instead, those expecting Hamilton to drive off into the distance with the championship got a surprise ? and a welcome one for fans of a title dust up.Ferrari were much too quick for Mercedes around the Hungaroring, where Sebastian Vettel qualified on pole for today?s race alongside his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen second. ?The car was phenomenal and when I saw it was two reds up front I let out a big scream,? said Vettel after qualifying. ?It?s only Saturday of course and the big challenge comes tomorrow, but after all the talk after the last race [that Ferrari were finished] it was good to give the answer on the track.? If Hamilton is to claim a sixth win at one of his favourite circuits, and overturn his one-point deficit at the top of the drivers? championship, he will have to do it the hard way.The three-time world champion starts fourth behind his team-mate Valtteri Bottas in an all-Mercedes second row who help to make up a nicely symmetrical front eight; Max Verstappen leads Daniel Ricciardo in an all-Red Bull third row, and Fernando Alonso starts ahead of Stoffel Vandoorne for the resurgent McLaren who occupy the fourth row ? their finest grid positions of the season. Formula One takes its summer break after Hungary, making this a pretty handy moment to land a telling blow. Vettel is in position to do just that.Lights out: 1pm BST, 2pm local time Updated

"The Snapdeal Founders have written an email to employees explaining the layoffs of around 600 people. ""Did we make errors in our execution? No doubt about that. Over the last 2-3 years, with all the capital coming..., our entire industry, including ourselves, started making mistakes."" ""All of us starting with myself and Rohit, are to blame for it,"" it added. ","summarize: Snapdeal is going through tough times. Today we heard that the company cut 600 jobs and that there is a lot of confusion and chaos in its offices. Also the company founders have taken a full, which means 100 per cent, salary cut. The gravity of the situation can be ascertained from the email that Snapdeal founders have presumably written to the company employees. It has been leaked and posted on Pastebin so far now we are not completely sure that this is the complete and genuine email. But it sure seems to have come from the founders. Here is the full text:--At Snapdeal, we find ourselves at an important point in our journey - we know where we want to go and now is the time to make the choices of how we will get there.Has our company and industry been going through a troubled time? Absolutely. Did we make errors in our execution? No doubt about that. Over the last 2-3 years, with all the capital coming into this market, our entire industry, including ourselves, started making mistakes. We started growing our business much before the right economic model and market fit was figured out. We also started diversifying and starting new projects while we still hadn't perfected the first or made it profitable. We started building our team and capabilities for a much larger size of business than what was required with the present scale.Ambition is critical, because that's what motivates us to give our very best every single day - to achieve the undoable. However, a large amount of capital with ambition can be a potent mix that drives a company to defocus from its core. We feel that happened to us. We started doing too many things, and all of us starting with myself and Rohit, are to blame for it.That said, there is almost no successful company on the planet, which hasn't gone through this phase in their lifetime - Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Tesla, Lego, Spicejet, you name it! Each one of them had painted themselves into a corner many times over before they became as wildly successful as they are today. A quick look at their stock prices over the last 15 years will show you what we're talking about. The formula to revive the company is uncannily similar for almost all of them - focus on only your core, stop all non-core activities, reduce costs drastically, turn profitable as soon as you can, and use those profits to spur further growth and new projects. We must do the same, and there is no doubt that with the really smart folks we have in the company, we will make it something that we are all very proud of.This also comes with some tough decisions in the short term. As part of our overall path to profitability plan that is currently in full swing, we will be reorganizing the company into a lean, focused, and entrepreneurial one. We are combining teams, reducing layers, eliminating non-core projects and strengthening the focus on profitable growth. Sadly, we will also be saying really painful goodbyes to some of our colleagues in this process. This is by far the hardest decision that we have ever taken in our lives. Our colleagues are our friends before they are co-workers, and I feel a deep sense of disappointment that we won't be able to have them continue on this journey with us. We will do what we can to help them with their transition to their next opportunity. We take this time to express our sincere gratitude to all those who are leaving us -your contributions have helped build Snapdeal in ways big and small. With time, I am confident, that we will be able to welcome back some of our colleagues who will be leaving us at this point. And that point, we will be a self sufficient, profitable company.Daunting as it may appear in the moment, it is important that we do this now, so that we can continue on our overall mission of building a successful, profitable business that provides incredible opportunities to our customers, sellers and partners. This also means more responsibility for the team members continuing on this journey with us.We believe that every resource of the company should be deployed for driving us towards profitable growth and with this announcement, both Rohit and I are taking a 100% salary cut. Many of our leaders have also stepped up proactively and offered to take a significant cut in their compensation, which is an excellent sign of how galvanised the team feels in this shared quest for profitability.These are tough times, no doubt. But, I am supremely confident, that like we have done before as a team, we will prevail. The greatest companies in the world got built in many interesting patterns - we just can't tell the pattern while are in the midst of it. For now, we need to keep our heads down, focus all our energy on execution that delivers on our two focus areas - best customer and seller experience, and profitable growth. This will mean tough choices and a conscious departure from a me-too race to the edge of the cliff. Let's remember - GMV is vanity, Profit is sanity.I have seen that whenever we put our minds to a well-defined plan, which we believe in unequivocally, we make progress like nobody else can. I am glad that we have picked our path clearly - of building a profitable business over the next two years."

"The Maldivian Opposition has alleged that it was blocked from entering the Parliament on Monday to take part in an impeachment vote against the Speaker Abdulla Maseeh Mohamed, after the military locked it down on the orders of President Yameen Abdul Gayoom. The Opposition is trying to oust the Speaker for blocking requests to summon government officials accused of corruption.n","summarize: The Maldivian opposition said that the military locked down parliament on Monday on the orders of the country?s president in a bid to prevent lawmakers from taking part in a vote to impeach the parliamentary speaker.The main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party said that on the orders of President Yameen Abdul Gayoom, the gates of the parliament were padlocked by members of the armed forces on Monday morning and lawmakers ?were forcibly prevented from entering the parliamentary compound.?In a statement, the opposition party called Yameen?s action ?desperate, illegal and unconstitutional.?There was no immediate comment from the government. The government spokesmen could not be reached by telephone.A no-confidence motion against Speaker Abdulla Maseeh Mohamed was scheduled to be taken up on Monday. The opposition says the motion has gained the support of 45 lawmakers in the 85-member house. However, an uncertainty arose when the election commission announced last week that the four members who supported the motion had lost their seats because they left the ruling party.The motion was considered a severe blow to Yameen, whose control over parliament was threatened by a new understanding between the Maldives? former strongman and its first democratically elected president, Mohamed Nasheed. The Maldivian Democratic Party routed Yameen?s party in local council elections earlier this year.A similar opposition bid to oust the speaker was thwarted in March when the government defeated it by 48 votes, with none opposing. At the time, opposition lawmakers were either evicted or walked out from a vote on ousting the speaker following a dispute over problems with the electronic voting system.The coalition?s plan to wrest the parliamentary majority was aimed at reforming the judiciary, elections commission and other bodies perceived as being partial toward Yameen.In March, Nasheed and former strongman Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and two other parties signed an agreement to form an opposition alliance.Maumoon runs a rival faction within the Progressive Party of Maldives, which is led by the current president, his half-brother.Nasheed was jailed in 2015 for 13 years for ordering the arrest of a senior judge when he was president in 2012.However, he traveled to Britain last year on medical leave and received asylum there. Three other leading politicians have also been jailed after trials criticized internationally for a lack of due process. Yameen is accused of rolling back many of the democratic gains since the Maldives became a multiparty democracy in 2008."

Clarke: I think Ishant Sharma deserves to be in the team. Bhuvneshwar Kumar is a great player. He has great record against the left-handers, especially against Warner. India would want to get him in the squad. But I think Ishant surely deserves a place. CLICK TO WATCH FULL INTERVIEWQuestion: If it is a good pitch in Bengaluru, which team will have the advantage?Clarke: It is a first innings game... it is very critical to make as many runs in the first innings. Doesn't really matter if you win or lose the toss. You have to get a good score in the first innings. It sets the tone up. We have seen that now in a tough wicket in Pune. Test match is literally over in the first innings. It will be no different in Bengaluru. The wicket will deteriorate over the five days. So, on a good wicket, toss doesn't matter. You just want to score more runs in the first innings. Question: How would you get Steve Smith out?Clarke: Laughs... Smith is in unbelievable form... a lot like Virat Kohli. Some times you have to just watch and applaud when a player is in such terrific form. I think India had a lot of opportunities to get him out in Pune. There's now doubt India will have plans for each Australian batsmen. My advice to India would be to hand on to your catches. #AskMichael what advice you give to team india when they are using DRS system in test match where you have only 2 reviews for 80 overs#AskMichael Do you think India should open with Vijay and Pujara and send KL Rahul to bat at No. 3 with Kohli coming in at No. 3??NO CHANGES FOR AUSTRALIA:Clarke: I don't think Australia will make any change in Bengaluru. They have won the first Test and have the momentum. I think they will go with the same team in Bengaluru. On Ajinkya Rahane: Clarke: I think Rahane is a wonderful player... think India will give him another opportunity. I think India will make a change in Bengaluru. They will go with two spinner - R Ashwin and R Jadeja. I like to see Rahane in the team. If he is good form, that puts India in dominant position. Boria Majumdar: You had dinner with Virat Kohli last night. Give us some insights about his mind.Clarke: Virat Kohli is a strong character. He is ready and focused on the Bengaluru Test. I consider Kohli as the best batsman right now in all formats. Question: What India need to do to win in Bengaluru?Clarke: India need to combat the big four players in Bengaluru. David Warner, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood. If India can keep these four quiet in Bengaluru, they can win the Test match.  Michael Clarke: Positive for Australian cricket that they have won the first Test. But they know what challenge lies ahead. I am very impressive with what Virat Kohli said after the Pune loss.Australia now are confident that they can beat India at their own backyard. That's a big boost for the visitors. Ask me your questions live today on @indiatoday at 6pm IST with @boriamajumdar by using the hashtag #AskMichael"

They helped at least 50 people without proper documentation leave the country, police said.","summarize: The Mumbai Police arrested two senior officers posted at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport for allegedly letting people pass through immigration without due process. The officers - identified as Anil Surse (35) and Harshal Patil (33) - were arrested after a major case of illegal transportation of humans was busted last month. Mumbai Police's Sahar unit made the arrest. According to police officials, they uncovered the racket after arresting a woman who was travelling to Vancouver, Canada under a fake name and passport. During interrogation, the woman provided information on the racket and named three men believed to be the masterminds. Mumbai police then arrested the three men - Gaurav Singh, Mukadam Gulam Ali and Mustakil Hussain. The three used to arrange the illegal passage of people out of the country. During their interrogation, the police stumbled upon the involvement of the immigration officers, who later confessed to their crime.A police officer said, ""The officers would let people (through immigration) without checking them. They would not check whether (the) passport is legal or not, all details are right or not."" The officer said that senior airport officials have launched a separate inquiry into the matter. According to the police, as many as 50 people without proper documentation were able to leave India under the two officers' watch.

"India on Friday successfully test-fired its indigenously developed nuclear-capable Prithvi-II missile from the Integrated Test Range in Odisha as part of a user trial by the Indian armed forces. The surface-to-surface medium-range ballistic missile, which was inducted into Indian armed forces in 2003, is capable of carrying 500-1,000 kg of warheads and is thrust by liquid propulsion twin engines. ","summarize: India today successfully test-fired its indigenously developed nuclear-capable Prithvi-II missile from a test range in Odisha as part of a user trial by the Army. The trial of the surface-to-surface missile, which has a strike range of 350 km, was carried out from a mobile launcher from launch complex-3 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Chandipur near here at around 9.50 am, official sources said. The trial of the sophisticated missile was successful and the mission objectives were met, they said. The Prithvi-II missile is capable of carrying 500 kg to 1,000 kg of warheads and is thrusted by liquid propulsion twin engines. It uses advanced inertial guidance system with manoeuvring trajectory to hit its target with precision and accuracy. The state-of-the-art missile was randomly chosen from the production stock and the entire launch activities were carried out by the specially formed strategic force command (SFC) and monitored by the scientists of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as part of training exercise, a DRDO scientist said. ""The missile trajectory was tracked by the DRDO radars, electro-optical tracking systems and telemetry stations located along the coast of Odisha,"" the sources said. Teams on board the ship deployed near the designated impact point in the Bay of Bengal monitored the terminal events and splashdown. In salvo mode, two Prithvi-II missiles were successfully test fired in quick succession from the same base, on November 21, 2016. Inducted into Indian armed forces in 2003, the nine-metre-tall, single-stage liquid-fuelled Prithvi-II is the first missile to have been developed by the DRDO under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme.

"Actress Sana Khan, while speaking about Salman Khan hugging her on the red carpet at an awards show, said she can't believe that a normal hug was trending. ""People just blew it out of proportion because [Salman] had closed fists, and some dumb people even called it an awkward hug,"" she added while slamming those who trolled her.","summarize: Actor Sana Khan was up for a not-so-pleasant surprise on Tuesday, when a video of her hugging actor Salman Khan went viral for all the wrong reasons. Sana walked the red carpet at a recently held TV awards show in Mumbai, and when she spotted Salman, the two exchanged a hug. What made it news was Salman?s closed fists, and his shy smile. ?I still can?t believe that a normal hug was trending, trolling, and rolling,? says Sana. ?People just blew it out of proportion because [Salman] had a closed fist, and some dumb people even called it an awkward hug.?

Sana replies, ?Who am I to make him feel uncomfortable? It?s stupid to put somebody down by saying such a nasty thing and showing me in a wrong light. It?s not [as if] I went to hug him and he didn?t recognise me.?But why that closed fist? ?Couldn?t it be somebody?s style? Maybe he hugs like that. I don?t know. I think the best person [whom] to ask this would be Salman.

"Responding to Saif Ali Khan's letter wherein he discussed nepotism and genetics, Kangana Ranaut wrote in her letter that she'd be a farmer if Saif's point on genetics was true. She added, ""Are you implying that artistic skills, hard-work...can be inherited through genes?"" Saif had written about people being interested in star kids and if they'll have their parents' genes.","summarize: All hell broke loose when Karan Johar, Saif Ali Khan and Varun Dhawan took a dig at Kangana Ranaut at the recently held IIFA Awards. Unless you have been living under a rock, you know that Kangana had called Karan the ""flag-bearer of nepotism"" on his show. The comment snowballed into a huge debate, with fans supporting Kangana for bravely taking on Bollywood's big daddies.The debate was reignited at the IIFA Awards this year, when Varun came on stage to receive an award. Saif joked, ""You are here because of your papa (director David Dhawan)."" Varun responded, ""And you're here because of your mummy (veteran actress Sharmila Tagore)."" Karan joined in and said, ""I am here because of my papa (late filmmaker Yash Johar).""The trio then chanted in unison, ""Nepotism rocks"". They then broke into the song Bole Chudiye Bole Kangana, at which point Karan interjected, ""Kangana nahi bole toh achcha hai, bahut bolti hai.""The act caused outrage on social media and Karan, Saif and Varun were forced to apologise. Saif went a step further and wrote an open letter (first published in DNA), prompting Kangana to finally break her silence and pen her own open letter in Mid-Day.She said that the last time she was ""deeply pained and upset"" about the subject was when Karan dismissed talent as one of the main criteria for making it big in Bollywood. Citing the examples of legends like Dilip Kumar, Satyajit Ray and Guru Dutt, Kangana said that discrediting talent was ""absolutely bizarre."" The actor added that there are plenty of instances to prove that ""genuine hard work"" exists, ""beyond the superficiality of branded clothes and polished accents.""Talking about Saif's letter, she dismissed his statement that people need to ""take a chill pill and back off"" because he has already apologised to her. ""This is not my issue alone,"" Kangana wrote, adding that nepotism ""fails the test of objectivity and rationale."" She added that Swami Vivekananda, Albert Einstein and William Shakespeare ""didn't belong to a select few, they belonged to collective humanity.""She also addressed his remark that it was easy to confuse nepotism with genetics. Saif had written, ""People are interested in what their (superstars') children will be like and whether they will have the genes of their parents, in terms of their talent. If you need another example, then take race horses. We take a derby winner, mate him with the right mate and see if we can create another grand national winner. So, in that sense, this is the relationship between genetics and star kids.""""I fail to understand how you can compare genetically hybrid racehorses to artistes,"" Kangana wrote, asking if Saif believed that talent and dedication was only hereditary. ""If your point was true, I would be a farmer back home,"" she said.The Queen actor added, ""You also spoke of eugenics - which means controlled breeding of the human race. So far, I believe that the human race hasn't found the DNA that can pass on greatness and excellence. If it had, we would've loved to repeat the greatness of Einstein, Da Vinci, Shakespeare, Vivekananda, Stephen Hawking, Terence Tao, Daniel Day-Lewis, or Gerhard Richter.""Saif had blamed the media for perpetrating nepotism. He had said that his son, Taimur, was a paparazzi favourite before he turned a year old and is already hyped to be the ""next big thing."" It is only a matter of time before a producer cashes in on all that hype. Kangana rebutted with, ""No one is putting a gun to anyone's head to hire talent they don't believe in. So, there is no need to get defensive about one's choices.""Is there going to be a round two of debate? Let's wait and watch."

According to his 2014 poll affidavit, he had eight criminal cases against him, including charges related to homicide, rioting, criminal intimidation, and stopping public servants from doing duty. In 2014, he was involved in force-feeding a Muslim during Ramzan.","summarize: Three years ago, 11 Shiv Sena MPs created a ruckus at Delhi?s Maharashtra Sadan, where one of them force-fed a Muslim catering worker during the month of Ramzan. Among the MPs was Ravindra Gaikwad.The 56-year-old Gaikwad is in the eye of the storm again for beating up an Air India staffer after a Pune-Delhi flight landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport on Thursday morning. This incident, or the Maharashtra Sadan episode, was not Gaikwad?s first run-in with the law.As per his affidavit filed ahead of the 2014 General Elections, Gaikwad has three criminal cases against him. In the past, the Osmanabad MP has been booked for voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty, culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and criminal intimidation.As per the affidavit, one of the cases was registered in Tuljapur, Osmanabad on March 13, 2003, while two other cases were registered in Omerga, Osmanabad, on January 9, 2013.On Thursday, a defiant and unapologetic Gaikwad admitted that he hit 60-year-old Air India duty manager R Sukumar ?25 times? and has dared Air India to take action against him. ?It was not my fault, it (the AI?employee) was his fault. He should apologise. First ask him to apologise then we will see,? Gaikwad told mediapersons in Delhi on Friday.He has been summoned by Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to Mumbai, even as the airline and other domestic carriers come together to demand a no-fly list for ?unruly passengers? such as him.

A PIL filed in Delhi High Court to disqualify the 11 MPs was dismissed later."
"All restaurants, including five-star hotels, in South Delhi have been directed by a Delhi civic body to make their toilets available to general public, who are not customers, at a fee of ?5 starting April 1. ""The move will be particularly beneficial for women who face problems due to lack of toilets in marketplaces,"" the South Delhi Municipal Corporation said.","summarize: Come April and you won?t have to go looking for public washrooms to relieve yourself after a long day of shopping in a South Delhi market. Just walk into the nearest restaurant, convey your need to the staff and you will be able to use the well-equipped toilet for a meagre Rs 5.The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Tuesday issued directions to all hotels, restaurants and eateries in its jurisdiction to make their washrooms accessible to the public from April 1. The move would allow anyone with Rs 5 in hand to access washrooms in even five-star hotels of South Delhi.According to an SDMC official, the decision has been taken on the advice of lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to explore the possibility of making toilets in restaurants and hotels open to public use.?We want the hotels and restaurants to adhere to the decision in full spirit rather than wait for the SDMC to enforce it,? said SDMC commissioner Puneet Goel.?The hotels and restaurants will also need to put up display boards informing the public about the facilities. The managements of these restaurants have been given the discretion to charge up to ~5 per usage to cover their costs towards maintenance and cleaning,? said the corporation official.The decision will be imposed on all the 4,618 eating outlets, including hotels, which are issued health trade licences by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation. ?These outlets also comprise 600 roadside eateries.

The study of tectonic plate movement has revealed that the Indian Plate is moving towards the Eurasian Plate at 45 millimetres per year, building pressure under the region.","summarize: A 5.8 magnitude earthquake rattled Uttarakhand  on Monday (February 6) evening  sending tremors all across north India, including Delhi and its adjoining areas, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab. Luckily, no damage to life or property was reported from Uttarakhand or other parts of north India rattled by the quake epicentered 31km below the earth surface in Pipalkoti near Rudraprayag.Uttarakhand and the northern Himalayan region have witnessed several high and medium intensity tremors in the recent past. Nepal was devastated by a magnitude 7.9 quake on April 25, 2015. However, experts have warned of a catastrophic earthquake in north India in near future. Several reports based on study of movement of tectonic plates have pointed out that a catastrophic earthquake could hit Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and other parts of north India in years to come.Scientists of Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) said that the big one could come sooner than expected. Dr Sushil Kumar, senior scientist at WIHG,  explained the Indian Plate is moving towards the Eurasian Plate at the speed of 45 mm/year causing immense pressure under the earth surface in the region, a report in Jagran  said.The Himalayan region has had four major earthquakes in the past 150 years. According to geologists, the regions between Kangra and Nepal-Bihar did not experience any earthquake for a long time till the April 25, 2015 earthquake. The region was the ""maximum probable zone"" for an earthquake.

These plates frequently slip and slide, causing earthquakes. We don't feel the small ones. The big ones, literally, shake us up.The Himalayas and north India are on particularly shaky ground. Sometime in the geological past, before humans, India broke off from an ancient supercontinent called Gondwana, a name still used for what is now Chhattisgarh.The Indian plate skewed north, displaced an ancient sea, travelled more than 2,000 km - the fastest a plate has ever moved - and slammed into the Eurasian plate, creating the Himalayas.About 60 per cent of India is vulnerable to earthquakes caused by the great, northward grind of the Indian subcontinental landmass.according to geologists, the 1950 Assam earthquake may have geologically set the stage for a really big one in the Himalayas. Now that 65 years have passed, it may be time for a big one.(With inputs from IANS)"

Starc was bowling a fiery spell on Sunday and Abhinav Mukund was in the firing line. As it happened, a top-edge off his bat flew over his head for a six. It was then that Starc rubbed his forehead with his index finger.Ashwin was clearly standing up for a teammate and added insult to Starc's injury after a crucial blow. While India's players have been matured enough to leave the onfield rivalry behind, Starc's latest comments could pave the way for another controversy. In 2014, Australian batsman Phil Hughes was killed after being hit on the head by a bouncer. Ever since, there have been serious concerns after batsmen have copped blows on their headgear. Starc, in retrospection, might be embarrassed with his words. Australia, the pioneers of mental disintegration, have been clearly rattled by India's onslaught over the last two decades. In 2014, the likes of David Warner and Steve Smith were involved in some heated moments with Indian cricketers before Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma responded in kind. "
"Ex-England cricketer Geoffrey Boycott named his Dream XI cricket team which did not feature any of the Indian greats. Boycott said he did not pick Gavaskar in the side as batsmen from yesteryears like WG Grace and Jack Hobbs played under higher degree of challenges. ""The Dream XI selected by the ICC's online readers insults...achievements of the greats,"" added Boycott.","summarize: Believe it or not. No Indians, not even the legends like Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev or Sachin Tendulkar featured in England great Geoffrey Boycott's all-time best World XI.Speaking at a private function in Mumbai, when asked to pick his all-time best World XI, no Indian made the grade in Boycott's assessment.""I can't pick Indians just to please you,"" Boycott told the audience. ""I can't get in the team myself. Gavaskar was a wonderful player and friend. Can I pick him ahead of Grace and Hobbs? Grace's numbers would look rubbish with 30 something. But you can't compare with today where wickets are wonderfully prepared. Back then, pitches were full of stones. They would have to wait till 2 pm to make the pitch dry. Today they would get mad if they are given wet wickets,"" he explained. Having chosen legends WG Grace and Sir Jack Hobbs as his openers, Boycott went on to pick Sir Donald Bradman and West Indian George Headley. Many of Boycott's choices were those of yesteryears as the greater degree of challenges they faced than the batsmen of today. ""George Headley may have played only 20 something games but they called him 'the black Bradman'. He played at a time when West Indies were not doing well,"" he said.""You have to look at the relativity of the players of that era. Look at Bradman he was twice as good as me,"" he opined. Boycott brought two more West Indians Sir Vivian Richards and Sir Garfield Sobers in the mix. Both of these choices would probably tally with most of the experts.""People pick players of today.

""I wouldn?t rent it to u if u were the last person on earth,? the host told her.","summarize: An Airbnb host who canceled a woman?s reservation using a racist remark has been ordered to pay $5,000 in damages for racial discrimination and take a course in Asian American studies.Dyne Suh, a 26-year-old law clerk, had booked Tami Barker?s mountain cabin in Big Bear, California, for a skiing weekend with friends in February, but Barker canceled the reservation by text message minutes before they arrived,stating: ?I wouldn?t rent it to u if u were the last person on earth? and ?One word says it all. Asian?.This is the first time an Airbnb host has been penalized for racial discrimination under a landmark agreement between the San Francisco-headquartered accommodation marketplace and the California department of fair employment and housing (DFEH), announced earlier this year. The agreement allows the regulator to test and penalize Airbnb hosts for racial bias. In addition to paying monetary damages and taking a college-level course in Asian American studies, Barker must agree to comply with anti-discrimination laws, make a personal apology to Suh, participate in a community education panel and volunteer with a civil rights organization.?We were thinking pretty creatively with this agreement,? said Kevin Kish, director of DFEH. ?The law tends to be backwards-looking, focusing on compensating people for harm. We?re interested in remedies that repair harm and transform relationships.?Suh booked Barker?s place for a long weekend with her fiance in February 2017 a month in advance for $250 a night. When Suh later asked if it was OK to bring two friends and two dogs along, Barker said it was fine but the group would need to pay an additional $50 a night, according to screenshots of their text messages. On the day of the booking, the foursome drove for hours in the rain and snow to Big Bear. Minutes away from the house, Suh texted Barker to let them know they were close and to confirm the cost of the stay. According to Suh, Barker then denied she ever agreed to having two extra guests and canceled the reservation, despite Suh sending her screenshots of their earlier agreement.When Suh said she?d complain to Airbnb about the racist remark, Barker replied: ?It?s why we have Trump ? and I will not allow this country to be told what to do by foreigners.?In an emotional video immediately after the incident, Suh said: ?I just feel so hurt. People thought: ?Oh, with the election of President Obama racism is over in this country.? No, it?s very much alive, it exists and it could happen to anyone.??It stings that after living in the US for over 23 years this is what happens. No matter if I follow the law ... no matter how well I treat others, it doesn?t matter. If you?re Asian, you?re less than human and people can treat you like trash.?After Suh complained, Airbnb carried out its own investigation and banned Barker from the platform.Suh also complained to DFEH, leading to a separate investigation, mediation and an agreement between the two parties, negotiated last week. The idea of making the host attend the Asian American studies course came out during mediation sessions. ?A lot of times when we see bias incidents it involves a lack of understanding of the experiences and histories of a particular group of people,? Kish said. ?This was a creative way to address that core underlying cause of the bias.??We want there to be strong anti-discrimination protections and preventions of harm, but we recognize that the world isn?t divided into good guys and bad guys. Humans have biases and we also need to recognize that humans change.?Barker?s lawyer Edward Lee said in a statement that his client was ?regretful for her impetuous actions and comments? but pleased to have resolved the matter with Suh and the DFEH ?in a manner that can hopefully bring a positive outcome out of an unfortunate incident?.Airbnb allowed the DFEH to regulate it for racial bias following a 10-month investigation based on a growing number of reports suggesting hosts regularly refuse to rent to guests due to their race, a problem exposed in 2016 under the hashtag #AirbnbWhileBlack.Until that point, Airbnb, like other ?sharing economy? companies including Uber and Instacart, had repeatedly resisted industry regulations, arguing that it was a ?platform? and not subject to local laws and requirements that apply to similar businesses. Under the agreement, Airbnb allows the government to test for racial discrimination by hosts in California who have been subject to discrimination complaints and have three or more listings. The ?fair housing testing? echoes the process DFEH investigators have used in the traditional rental market where black and white applicants, with otherwise identical backgrounds, are both sent to try and secure a lease from a landlord. With Airbnb, investigators can set up fake accounts and make reservation requests to hosts to see if they are discriminating. Kish hopes that this first case will send a message to hosts: ?We?re watching,? he said. ?But we?re willing to be creative.? ?We are interested in facilitating the types of outcomes that allow people to not only be compensated for harm but transform their relationships with each other and their communities.?Airbnb did not respond to a request for comment.

In the US, tax evasion by multinational corporations via offshore jurisdictions is estimated to be at least $130bn (£99bn) a year. The researchers reported that there were 24 so-called ?sink? offshore financial centres where foreign capital was ultimately stored, safe from the tax authorities.Of those, 18 are said to have a current or past dependence to the UK, such as the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and Jersey.The tax havens used correlated heavily to which conduit country was chosen by the multinational?s accountants.The UK is a major conduit for investments going to European countries and former members of the British Empire, such as Hong Kong, Jersey, Guernsey or Bermuda, reflecting the historical links and tax treaties enjoyed by firms setting up in Britain. The Netherlands is a principal conduit for investment ending in Cyprus and Bermuda, among others. Switzerland is used as a conduit to Jersey. Ireland is the route for Japanese and American companies to Luxembourg.In terms of the purpose, on paper, of the corporate structures, the Netherlands specialises in providing holding companies. The UK provides head offices and fund management and Ireland offers financial leasing and the provision of head offices.?Our results show that offshore finance is not the exclusive business of exotic small islands far away,? the researchers write in an article for theacademic journal Scientific Reports. ?Countries such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom play a crucial yet previously hidden role as conduits of offshore finance on its way to tax havens.?Dr Eelke Heemskerk, who led the research, said that the work showed the importance of developed countries cleaning up their financial sectors.He said: ?In the context of Brexit, where you have the UK threatening, unless they get a deal, to change their model to be attractive to companies who want to protect themselves from taxes, well, they are already doing it.?The Netherlands says they won?t let the UK be an offshore tax haven. That?s because they don?t want them taking their business.?"

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday ordered his cabinet to attend a welcome ceremony for US President Donald Trump, after discovering that many of them planned to skip the event, reports said. Notably, Israeli officials have criticised the visit as ""haphazard"". Trump arrived in Israel on Monday in the second leg of his first overseas trip as President. ","summarize: Israel?s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has reportedly been forced to order his ministers to attend the airport reception for Donald Trump on Monday, after discovering that a number had planned not to attend.According to reports in the Israeli media, an angry Netanyahu was informed on Sunday that party heads and a number of ministers planned to skip the reception after the White House had asked for the meet and greet to be shortened to the two countries? anthems and handshakes only between Netanyahu and Trump.Haaretz, the Times of Israel and the Jerusalem Post all carried stories, some quoting an identified Israeli government official on the instruction from Netanyahu, amid claims that ministers had been upset at not being included in the receiving line on the airport tarmac.The row is the latest in a series of controversies to hit the planned visit of the US president, which officials in Israel have privately characterised as often haphazard.Trump will arrive for the whirlwind visit to Israel and to the occupied Palestinian territories on Monday, amid mounting questions over what ? if any ? practical steps he will take to advance his ?ultimate peace deal? between the two sides.Overshadowed by the escalating scandals surrounding him, the US president will meet Netanyahu and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, during 26 hours of events.Trump will arrive from Riyadh on Air Force One just before noon at Ben Gurion airport, accompanied by his wife, Melania, daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared, before flying by helicopter to Jerusalem.During his visit, Trump will briefly visit the Holocaust memorial at Yad Vashem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City, dine with Netanyahu and make a private visit to the Western Wall, Judaism?s most holy site. Then on Tuesday morning Trump will meet Abbas in Bethlehem before flying on to Rome.Speaking at his weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, ahead of Trump?s arrival, Netanyahu said: ?I will discuss with President Trump ways to strengthen our primary and steadfast ties with the United States. We will improve our security ties, which we are strengthening on a daily basis. We will also discuss ways to advance the peace.?The visit will take place under tight security with about 10,000 police securing the Israeli part of the visit, which will be accompanied by road closures. Trump will spend a single night in a suite in the King David hotel protected by glass capable of withstanding a rocket-propelled grenade and a poison gas attack. The visit comes at a tense time ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Six Day War in early June ? which for Palestinians marks five decades of occupation ? and amid a continuing hunger strike by hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails that has prompted sometimes violent demonstrations on the West Bank.Trump?s problems at home are also seen by some as having cast a pall over the proceedings, with Dan Shapiro, the former US ambassador to Israel under Barack Obama, predicting: ?I think the trip?s in a lot of jeopardy [in] being able to be productive because of all the chaos and controversy that?s going on in Washington.? Despite the signs posted in Jerusalem neighbourhoods welcoming Trump as ?a friend of Zion? and calling on hims to ?make Israel great?, his visit is also causing anxieties for many on Israel?s right for whom Trump?s election was seen initially as the cause for unbridled celebration. Since his inauguration on 20 January, those same rightwingers fear that Trump has drifted towards an ever more conventional US foreign policy position on the peace process.Far from moving the US embassy to Jerusalem on his first day in office ? as he promised ? Trump has kicked that issue into the long grass while expressing a sometimes garbled objection to Israeli settlement building.That has seen David Friedman, the controversial and pro-settler new US ambassador to Israel who arrived last week, move quickly to reassure Netanyahu?s government that Trump remains as firmly committed to Israel as ever, even as he suggested that no announcement on the US embassy would be made until after Trump?s visit.The messaging on the Israel-Palestine peace process has also been downbeat, with one US official telling Haaretz on Sunday that the height of Trump?s ambitions for his ?ultimate deal? right now appears to involve no more than encouraging the two sides to play nicely to create conditions for direct talks.?The president has made a general statement regarding his view on settlements and he hopes the Israeli government takes it into account,? the official said. ?He was also pretty direct with President Abbas regarding what they need to do regarding incitement and the payments to families of terrorists. He has been quite clear about that and he will be clear about that during the visit.?Instead, the expectation will be that Trump will neither outline a vision for a framework for the peace process nor any concrete steps. What noises that have emerged from reported leaks about Trump?s plans to advance peace suggest an implausible mishmash of ideas ? including the idea that Israel be allowed to continue settlement building during talks.On the Israeli side the most significant outcome is a proposal for improving the economic quality of life for Palestinians on the West Bank, including longer opening hours for the Allenby Bridge crossing to Jordan, more building permits in the so-called area C and suggestions for new industrial zones on the West Bank.Lacking any clear prospects for a breakthrough, the runup to the visit has been dominated by mini ? and sometimes concocted ? controversies including the comment by a US official telling Netanyahu?s office that the Western Wall was not in Israeli territory.Trump will, however, become the first US president to visit the wall, a fact that was being spun last week by Jonathan Schanzer of the rightwing US Foundation for Defence of Democracies as a pro-Israel step.?I think that if Trump himself goes to the Western Wall and does it with Israeli officials, even Israeli security, there?s going to be very little argument over who controls it ? certainly [when] going there to acknowledge it as a Jewish holy site,? said Schanzer.On the Palestinian side, officials appear content that the worst predictions regarding Trump on the Middle East ? fuelled by his own campaign rhetoric ? have not materialised. ?We?re happy that, contrary to initial expectations, the Trump administration has been willing to listen,? one official said. ?Our readout is that Trump was surprised by Abbas?s declaration of his willingness to make peace, having being told the opposite by some of his advisers.?"

In that process, we might be really losing out on quite a few interesting stories that should be told, and I do hope that the environment changes.?Movies like Lipstick Under My Burkha and Udta Punjab ran foul of the censor board but were cleared after appeals or cuts.Kapur, former head honcho of Studios, Disney UTV, said that former actress Smriti Irani?s appointment as Cabinet Minister for Information and Broadcasting, would bring about a change for the Indian film industry which was constantly battling censorship woes. ?It?s a very positive step because she?s someone who understands the industry. I?m quite certain that we will see an easy and a more liberal view of film certification in the months to come,? Kapur said.?I believe that the (government-appointed) Shyam Benegal Committee has made some very good recommendations on what should be done as far as the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) is concerned. I do hope that?s implemented at the earliest,? added Kapur.Given that the $2 billion film industry of India, one of the largest movie-producing nations in the world, was not generating the moolah it should for a multiple of reasons -- lack of screens, slowdown in domestic theatrical revenue, steady growth in Hollywood market share and emergence of digital platforms and quality content -- Kapur sees light at the end of the tunnel.?Every industry goes through cyclical times. The cycle we are going through right now is where the economics are very challenging. Having said that, I?m quite optimistic that since we have a very strong movie-going culture, our own ethos of a star system and our own grammar of storytelling, we will come out of this,? said Kapur.?I think it?s about the industry figuring out an economic model that makes sense to everyone in the value chain rather than for a few people. And once that changes, we will see the industry do much better,? he said, adding how filmmakers need to be ?smart about their films?, release date and strategy.As for Hollywood eating into local films? business, he said, ?It?s happening and it?s definitely something to be concerned about... Because the fact is that they are making movies that are bringing people to cinemas... And that?s what we need to do too.?Exorbitant fee charged by stars can sometimes inflate a film?s budget, but breaking away from the strongly-rooted star system is going to be no answer either, said Kapur. ?I don?t think the star system will break and I don?t think it should. But I think that along with the star system, there needs to be great content that can stand on its own without any star. I have seen so many movies in the recent past that have done this and have done it very effectively,? he said.Kapur has been associated -- as producer, co-producer or associate producer -- with a mix of these -- Dangal, Kai Po Che, The Lunchbox, Raajneeti, Barfi!, Chennai Express, Shahid, Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana, A Wednesday and Paan Singh Tomar. Now he is on a new journey of his own -- that of driving his home banner Roy Kapur Films.?I?m very excited about this next phase of my career where I will be looking at all kinds of content across the board, genre-agnostic, completely. I just want to tell great stories; do some great movies that I can be proud of,? he said.His slate includes an Aamir Khan-starrer biopic on astronaut Rakesh Sharma and a biopic based on the life of a man named Vijendra Singh who had lost his wife Leela in the Uttarakhand floods.Not ready to spill more beans about any of his projects, Kapur said: ?It?s a little early to talk about any of them at this point of time.?"

US-based Fenox Venture Capital's CEO Anis Uzzaman has sued rival firm's male CEO Brandon Hill for allegedly pretending to be a female harassment victim in an anonymous blog post. Uzzaman claims Hill accused him of sexual misconduct in the post to damage his reputation. Uzzaman's attorneys said the blog post was traced to the IP address of his rival's house.,"summarize: An anonymous blogpost accusing a Silicon Valley venture capitalist of sexual misconduct was written by a male executive who pretended to be a female victim of harassment in order to damage the reputation of a competitor, according to a lawsuit.The complaint filed by Anis Uzzaman, a prominent tech investor and CEO of Fenox Venture Capital, alleged that a male rival CEO published a fake online account purporting to be an unnamed woman who was ?sexually taken advantage of? by Uzzaman. The blogpost, which said Uzzaman pressured the author to go to his hotel room after a business meeting, was written by Brandon Katayama Hill, founder and CEO of a San Francisco branding and marketing agency called Btrax that competes with Fenox, according to the suit. Uzzaman?s attorneys said the blogpost was traced to the IP address of Hill?s home. Reached for comment on Thursday, Hill denied that he was the author of the post, claiming that other people had access to his wifi and that he did not know who wrote it. The lawsuit comes at a time when women across Silicon Valley have come forward with allegations of sexual harassment following a viral account of misconduct and discrimination at Uber. Over the past month, there has been increasing scrutiny of venture capitalists following a series of stories alleging that powerful male investors have repeatedly harassed women seeking startup funding, who are particularly vulnerable and have few recourses to raise concerns when they are mistreated or assaulted by VCs.Uzzaman?s lawyers have alleged that Hill took advantage of the discussion about discrimination in the industry to target a rival. ?To have these false accusations come particularly in this climate when there?s this growing awareness of a problem that does exist, it?s damaging,? Katrina Saleen, Uzzaman?s attorney, told the Guardian. ?It?s also an insult to true victims of sexual harassment ? It makes people question the veracity of true victims, which is harmful.? According to the complaint, the blogpost, titled ?I was sexually taken advantage of by a Silicon Valley VC?, was published in March on a popular Japanese blog site, Hatena. The post said the author met the ?very famous? VC at a local startup event and that he asked her to meet and talk about business. The VC invited the woman to go on a trip with her and stay at a five-star hotel, and when she refused, he said: ?You are going to lose the biggest opportunity if you do not come,? according to the post. The VC said he might invest in her and pressured her to go to his hotel that night, but she refused, the post said. Later, he stopped communicating with her, saying: ?I?m busy, don?t contact me.? ?A lot of people from Japan, including students, and many very cute girls come to him, and he takes advantage of them,? said the blogpost, which was written in Japanese and translated to English in the complaint. The blog did not name Uzzaman but he was easily identifiable, according to the complaint. There are only a few Silicon Valley companies that do venture capital services for Japan, and Fenox is the only firm which has a non-Japanese leader with ?dark skin? who is fluent in Japanese, as the blog outlined, the suit said. The comments section referenced Fenox and Uzzaman, according to the complaint. A Japanese court eventually ordered Hatena to produce the IP address traced to the article, and attorneys confirmed through Comcast that the post, published on a Saturday morning, was linked to the home address of Hill, the suit said. Hill?s company has offices in California and Japan and operates in the ?same general domain? as Uzzaman?s firm, working with startups funded by Japanese corporations, the complaint said.Hill also used to run a San Francisco startup competition called Japan Night, and Fenox Venture Capital last year launched a similar event called Startup World Cup. The blogpost was published weeks before the event.?This event is very important to them. For this to have come out just before ? is damaging,? said Saleen.In a short phone interview, Hill said he had not yet seen the complaint, which was filed last week in San Mateo superior court, adding: ?I didn?t write the article. I?m not responsible for it. This is a false allegation.? Hill further claimed that more than 50 people had access to his wifi, though he declined to identify them. He also declined to comment on whether he had suspicions on who may have authored the blogpost. He further claimed that his firm did not compete with Fenox: ?We are in totally different businesses.?Asked about Hill?s denial, Saleen said: ?Comcast has confirmed that the IP address that the blog was posted from is from Brandon Hill?s home ? We?ve also confirmed that he has password-protected wifi.? Through his attorney, Uzzaman declined to comment. "

"Stanford researchers have found an abundance of marine life at Bikini Atoll island, which was declared a nuclear wasteland after the US tested 23 bombs between 1946-1958, including one 1,100 times larger than the Hiroshima atom bomb. The team discovered a diverse ecosystem thriving in the crater with corals and fish, and crabs devouring radioactive coconuts on the shore.","summarize: The former island paradise of Bikini Atoll is slowing blooming back to life, 70 years after the United States dropped 23 nuclear bombs on it, including a device in 1954 that was 1,100-times larger than the Hiroshima atom bomb. A team of scientists from Stanford University have been surprised to discover an abundance of marine life apparently thriving in the crater of Bikini Atoll, which was declared a nuclear wasteland after the bombings, with its 167 inhabitants relocated to other islands.Steve Palumbi, a professor in marine sciences at the university, said the effects of radiation poisoning on ocean life have never been studied in-depth, and his team?s initial research suggests it is ?remarkably resilient?. Animals studied by scientists in and around the Chernobyl blast showed deformities and mutations, but the Stanford teams initial research suggest the marine life in Bikini may have fared significantly better. Palumbi?s team discovered a diverse eco-system of animal life in and around the bomb crater, including coral as big as ?cars?, hundreds of schools of fish including tuna, sharks and snapper, and coconut crabs devouring radioactive coconuts on the shore. Palumbi said to the naked eye the crabs, fish and coral of Bikini Atoll look perfectly normal and healthy, and some of the coral has been around for decades ? with evidence it may have begun growing as soon as 10 years after the last bombs were dropped.?The lagoon is full of schools of fish all swirling around the living coral. In a strange way they are protected by the history of this place, the fish populations are better than in some other places because they have been left alone, the sharks are more abundant and the coral are big. It is a remarkable environment, quite odd.? Palumbi?s team concentrated their research efforts on the coral and coconut crabs ? which are the size of hub caps ? because they have long-life spans, allowing the scientists to delve into what effect the radiation exposure has had on the animals DNA after building up in their systems for many years. Because fish have relatively short life-spans it is possible the worst-affected fish died off many decades ago, said Palumbi, and the fish living in Bikini Atoll today are only subject to low-levels of radiation exposure as they frequently swim in and out of the atoll. ?This is the most destructive thing we have ever done to the ocean, dropping 23 atomic bombs on it, yet the ocean is really striving to come back to life,? said Palumbi. ?The fact there is life there and the life there is trying to come back from the most violent thing we?ve ever done to it is pretty hopeful.?Even though plant, animal and ocean life is showing strong signs of recovery, humans are still unable to live and work on the atoll, besides a few caretakers who bring food and water supplies with them, and keep up the islands facilities. A United Nations report in 2012 said the effects of radiation were long-lasting. Special rapporteur Calin Georgescu, in a report to the UN human rights council, said ?near-irreversible environmental contamination? had led to the loss of livelihoods and many people continued to experience ?indefinite displacement?.The water cannot be drunk because of continued contamination, the seafood cannot be eaten, and plants cannot be farmed because of contaminated soil. More than half of the 167 original inhabitants of Bikini Atoll have now died, and many went to their graves still longing to return to their homeland. According to a paper by Timothy J. Jorgensen, associate professor of radiation medicine at Georgetown University, former residents of Bikini Atoll started showing cancers related to radiation exposure in the 1960s. Those down-wind of the explosions had burns and depressed blood counts. Those on islands further afield showed elevated risk for cancers, particularly thyroid cancers and leukaemia, and have been involved in a protracted compensation claim with the United States for decades. ?What happened to the Marshall Islanders next is a sad story of their constant relocation from island to island, trying to avoid the radioactivity that lingered for decades,? writes Jorgensen. ?Over the years following the testing, the Marshall Islanders living on the fallout-contaminated islands ended up breathing, absorbing, drinking and eating considerable amounts of radioactivity.?"
"Following a request by the Muslim Women's Sport Foundation, England's Amateur Swimming Association has allowed female swimmers to wear burkinis in amateur competitions. The outfit was previously banned as it was said to have performance-enhancing characteristics since it streamlined the shape of the body.

On a request from the Muslim Womens Sport Foundation, the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) has relaxed its swimsuit regulations to allow women to wear loose-fitting full body outfits. Until now, full body suits like those worn by Olympians have been banned, as they help streamline the shape of the body and have performance-enhancing characteristics. The new guidance, which will only apply to amateur competitions in England, states that competitors will not be allowed to wear any suit that a competition referee believes will increase performance, The Telegraph reported. Photographs published by the governing body suggested that loose-fitting outfits would be permissible, while specifically excluding body suits similar to those worn by elite competitors. ""Swimmers wishing to swim in such a suit shall present the suit to the event referee for inspection prior to their swim,"" the guidance states. ""Once the referee has been informed of a swimmer wishing to wear a suit, as described above, there is no requirement for the referee to question the swimmer further, the ASA swimming management group do not want athletes being asked why they wish to wear the suit,"" it says. Chris Bostock, chairman of the ASA sport governing board, termed the move as a ""very positive step forward"" for competitive swimming in England and one that he hoped would encourage many more people to take part.

To some, Nolan is a god, and his temple?s walls, dark and foreboding, seem to push in as the lights go down. Your senses, usually dulled by a mundane existence, are heightened. You?ve never experienced anything like it.The crowd?s hushed tones hit you in waves, and even the most distant whisper is deafening ? but it reassures as much as it startles. There are others like you. And like you, they?ve waited years for this moment. You are not alone. And the electricity you?ve created ? together ? in the cavernous place of worship, could power a small town.I have experienced this sensation on four occasions, before four Christopher Nolan films, and each of those experiences were, and remain to this day, some of the most special I?ve had inside a movie theatre.And yesterday, it happened again.Dunkirk, a film about men, created by men, is a force of nature ? an elemental beast of a movie about finding the meaning of life surrounded by the meaninglessness of war. It is an existential masterpiece set across three parallel plots destined to collide, which in turn are set on three planes of existence ? earth, air, and water. To us, these elements symbolise life, but in Dunkirk, they might as well be harbingers of death, having suspended our characters in their purgatory as they await judgment.On the land, in the seaside French town of Dunkirk, 400,000 soldiers have been pushed by ?the enemy? ? curiously, not once are the Nazis mentioned ? towards the sea. They wait, bombarded from behind, and up above, for deliverance. Before them lies a seemingly endless expanse of blue ? and home, England, is practically within sight, across the choppy waters of the Channel. They go from boat to boat ? some even conning their way onto the rickety barges ? desperate to get off the cursed beach, as torpedoes attack them from below, and missiles rain like hellfire from the sky.They?re in need of a miracle.But help is on its way. Tom Hardy protects them from above, acting, like he did in The Dark Knight Rises, through a mask, and only with his eyes. And his eyes are all he needs to convey the (sometimes scarily suicidal) determination to save his countrymen, as he picks off one Luftwaffe fighter after another ? even as his wingmen perish, and his fuel gauge begs him to stop.Below him, on the water, a civilian Mark Rylance has commandeered a boat, one of the many deployed by the Navy in an effort to aid the evacuation process. With his teenage son, and his son?s eager friend in tow ? but without a firm plan ? he sails into war.And with the precision of a watchmaker ? time is an oft-repeated motif in the film ? Nolan, a master working at the peak of his powers, puts the pieces of this jigsaw together with some of his most effortless editing since Inception. And like Inception, as layer after layer of Dunkirk?s nesting doll structure is uncovered, and when the three stories finally converge after almost two hours of merciless tension, the emotional release is pure ecstasy.Often, in order to build this tension, the experimental work of genius that it is, Dunkirk spends long stretches in silence. DP Hoyte van Hoytema?s IMAX camera, taking a break from soaring across the skies, wrestling for space among thousands of men, and gazing placidly at the sheer beauty of it all, brings the actors? faces inches from its own. And these fine performers ? mostly young stars (Harry Styles included) ? convey wordlessly the torment raging in their characters? minds.But because of these periods of silence, and because of Nolan?s refusal to rely on words (or, for that matter, a traditional structure) to tell his story, Hans Zimmer?s terrific score becomes crucial, and slowly, emerges as a character in its own right. Like the film, it is unrelentingly intense, stretched to breaking point as it conjures tension seemingly from nothing.And such is Nolan?s power at commanding the attention of his audience, that you find yourself overlooking basic flaws. There isn?t a single character in this film that is properly fleshed out, and it fails miserably at the Bechdel Test. But never have these glaring missteps mattered less.Do you remember what Bruce Wayne said at the end of The Dark Knight Rises? Moments before flying into certain death, he looked at Commissioner Gordon, and growled, ?A hero can be anyone.?And this is the sentiment that Nolan has carried into Dunkirk.

I feel Tubelight has all the capacity to make Hindi cinema proud all around the world and I would like to wish all the luck for the entire team of Tubelight.""But Salman, who has collaborated with Kabir Khan for the third time, thinks otherwise. In an interview to Firstpost, the Bajrangi Bhaijaan actor said, ""I doubt that Tubelight will break Baahubali 2's record, because the latter is one of the most freakish films that has been made. Hindi film-goers lapped up the film despite watching a dubbed version of it. It is because of the Hindi cine-goers that they have got these numbers.""However, the actor added, ""As long as nobody loses money, I am fine. I don't feel the pressure.""Set against the backdrop of 1962 Sino-Indian war, Tubelight tells the story of two brothers. It is after a gap of seven years that Salman and brother Sohail Khan will share screen space. The film, which is set to hit the screens this Eid, also stars Chinese actor Zhu Zhu and late Om Puri. "

Here?s a final submission from someone who used to work as a residential tutor, who contacted Guardian Australia anonymously to share their story:I was working in one of the residential colleges as a member of the staff, and was supporting a student through a case of sexual assault. It was escalated to the university and an internal investigation was conducted (I was not involved in the investigation, but sat in during the interviews). Basically, it was a case of the student?s word against the perpetrator?s and therefore the university concluded that there was not enough evidence to take any action. Based on our experience and from the testimonies given by both sides, my colleagues at the college who were involved in supporting the student and I knew that the victim?s account is more likely to be true than not, but we could not do anything without proof. And because the report came back without any conclusive result, we could not take any official action against the perpetrator. It was frustrating and I felt that we had truly let the victim down. To make it worse, the victim and the alleged perpetrator had to remain staying in the same college till the end of the year.Updated

The End Rape On Campus ambassador, Nina Funnell, has criticised the final report for scaling back its own sample size from an earlier census-esque proposal.The original survey was planned for all 1.3 million Australian university students but was reduced and only sent to 300,000, according to Funnell. Of those 300,000, only 31,000 answered. ?Perhaps the response rate would have been higher had the AHRC not trusted universities to select when to send the survey out,? she said.?Left to their own devices many of the universities sent the survey out during student exams when students have more pressing concerns.?Updated

Today?s report has been criticised by some advocates for implying that universities only have an obligation to deal with incidents that happen in a university setting ? either on campus or at a university event. But the co-women?s officer at the University of Sydney, Imogen Grant, told Guardian Australia today that assaults that occur outside of university grounds can still be reported to universities because they involve student perpetrators.She says we should keep in mind that student offenders can be disciplined by their university: Most incidents of assault occur around the broader university community, in share houses and at social events.But the perpetrators are still fellow students. And if the perpetrator is a fellow student, you can report that to the university and you can expect disciplinary action as well.It?s also an issue raised by End Rape On Campus ambassador Nina Funnell, who said in today?s media conference that the report?s 10-point plan had no recommendations for improving disciplinary proceedings against offenders. In response, the chair of Universities Australia, Prof Margaret Gardner, said she had ?begun a conversation? with universities about new misconduct proceedings. Here?s a submission from the report itself that claims this issue has been overlooked:A woman who was sexually assaulted on numerous occasions by her intimate partner, a fellow university student, was told the university had ?no power to do anything, because none of it occurred on-campus?.She felt that the university should have taken action, because she was aware of the perpetrator sexually assaulting at least two other women at her university.

It?s only later that you think about what happened and realise it?s not normal. The Eagle Rock thing? We did that. There was a weekly newsletter about who had slept with who. Everyone told rape jokes. We drank so much we couldn?t move. People who did not join in were ostracised.

As mentioned earlier today, only 9% of students who had been sexually assaulted on their campus reported the attack to their university. Here are some examples, in survivors? own words, of why they decided not to pursue the perpetrators of their assault or harassment. Multiple submissions said they were deterred by their university?s failure to provide anonymous reporting:Our cohort for our course is incredibly small. I felt too scared to report these incidents. I couldn?t have action taken against him because everyone would find out.Another student had their identity disclosed to their rapist?s friends: The university broke confidentiality by informing organisers of the camp (i.e: the rapist?s friends) what I?d done. People spread lies about me and I was ostracised from the club.Another said the university forced them into a process of face-to-face ?mediation? with their harasser:When I complained to the head of school I had a ?mediation? session with the professor who was harassing me ... he stormed out and slammed the door. He wasn?t told to change his behaviour, the ?mediation session? was all that was done.For many respondents there was always an underlying social pressure not to report, stemming from a fear of being ridiculed, ostracised or shamed for not doing enough. Said one: It was my word against his. He?s known as being a really nice friendly guy so I didn?t think a lot of people would believe me or care.Updated

Residential colleges at Australian universities are full of students from regional and remote areas, as well as international students, many of whom are living away from home for the first time. They?re usually co-ed.They?re also one of the highest risk places on campus for sexual assault and sexual harassment, according to the AHRC survey. Twelve per cent of women and 3% of men who were sexually assaulted at a university in 2015 and 2016 said it had occurred at a residential college.The report found that hazing practices at colleges often involved excessive alcohol consumption and humiliating or degrading acts, ?and, in many cases, sexual harassment and sexual assault?.According to one submission:The aim is to get the freshers as drunk as possible. Maybe a secondary aim is to make them look as ridiculous and embarrassing as possible, giving them costumes, props, and even sometimes smearing food all over them.Said another:You had to participate, there was nothing you could do about it. The administration knew about this and they condoned this. The students had no power whatsoever, you couldn?t say anything. Hazing practices described in the report included getting female students to ?run the gauntlet?, which meant running down a hallway where male students stood in every doorway with the nozzle of a cask of wine sticking out their fly. Female students were required to kneel before each male resident and ?drink from his sack?.Another college had a ritual where all first-year female students had to remove their top when a certain song was played. They would be surrounded by male students and unable to leave the dance floor with their top still on. Other submissions described year-round traditions that focused on residents? sexual exploits.Conquests of guys getting girls from other colleges were broadcasted weekly in this gossip session the whole college had, where you would submit your experiences to an executive, and on weeknights we would gather and hear about everyone?s conquests that week ... women were described as objects or trophies. The report also found that power relationships between resident advisers ? usually senior students ? and first-year students, as well as the close proximity created by living in residential colleges and the easy access to both alcohol and bedrooms, were contributing factors in the high rates of sexual assault.

In Baywatch, the film, too, the female lifeguards have little to do other than pander to the male gaze. Ladies, worry not, there are enough shots of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and Zac Efron's abs to keep you distracted from the lack of a solid plot.Dwayne plays Mitch Buchanon (originally played by David Hasselhoff), the leader of the lifeguard squad consisting of Stephanie (Ilfenesh Hadera), CJ (Kelly Rohrbach, stepping into Pamela Anderson's shoes), Summer (Alexandra Daddario), Matt Brody (Zac Efron) and Ron (Jon Bass). For Mitch, being a lifeguard is not just about getting a tan and occasionally saving people from drowning, but about ""saving the bay.""They get their opportunity when the Huntley Club gets a new owner, Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra), and things start going awry. Drugs and dead bodies start showing up on the beach, and the lifeguards are convinced that Victoria is somehow involved.The characters in Baywatch are largely unidimensional - Mitch is tough but emotional, the female lifeguards are mainly eye-candy and Matt is the stereotype of the cocky buff dude. Zac's Matt, the washed out Olympic gold medallist, almost gets some depth, but then the writers change their mind. One minute, he talks about his rough childhood spent in various foster homes, the next minute, he is back to being the thick-as-a-brick butt of jokes.Priyanka plays an alter ego of her Dil Dhadakne Do character in Baywatch - a girl who loses the family business to her brother, despite having the acumen, so she decides to come to the ""land of opportunity"" and rise to the top, by hook or by crook. She is convincing as the ruthless Victoria, but in terms of screen time, it feels like an extended cameo. Perhaps, some of the fault lies with the Indian Censor Board. Her ""Easy, Britney"" portion (from the trailer), for instance, is not in the final cut.Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron are as good as they can be in a film with a wafer-thin plot. Dwayne's deadpan delivery of a different emasculating insult directed at Zac's character every time (""One Direction,"" ""High School Musical,"" ""Bieber""...you get the gist) evokes some laughter. Jon Bass has his hilarious moments - when he sings Katy Perry's Roar in the shower and when he owns the dance floor.Baywatch, the film, has been remodelled as a comedy with far too many penis jokes, most of which are flaccid (pun intended). What does impress, however, is the cinematography. Visually, Baywatch looks great, with beautiful shots of the lifeguards diving into the crystalline water.David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson have somewhat confusing cameos just for the sake of it; they play the same characters as they did in the original. So Mitch 1 shares screen space with Mitch 2...you get it.If you're looking for a no-brainer with lots of eye-candy and low-intellect jokes, Baywatch makes for a decent one-time watch."

"Hackers behind the Petya ransomware attack, which hit computers in over 60 countries in late June, have wiped out nearly ?7 lakh worth of bitcoins from the digital wallet used to receive ransoms. After reports suggested that the hackers may be state-sponsored actors, they left a message offering to decrypt every infected computer for a one-off payment of ?1.7 crore.","summarize: The hackers behind the NotPetya ransomware, which wiped computers in more than 60 countries in late June, have moved more than £8,000 worth of bitcoins out of the account used to receive the ransoms.The transfer has added credence to messages purporting to be from the attackers offering to decrypt every single infected computer for a one-off payment of £200,000, after security researchers suggested they may be state-sponsored actors. It is possible to see the movement of the ransom payments thanks to the public nature of the bitcoin currency: all transfers are recorded on the public blockchain, although the real-world identities of the individuals or organisations behind a particular payment address can be near-impossible to discern.Currently, the blockchain records that the bulk of the ransom money, £7,872 worth of bitcoin, was simply transferred to a second wallet on Tuesday night, but two smaller payments, of £200 each, went to accounts used by two text-sharing websites, Pastebin and DeepPaste.Around 10 minutes before the payments were made, someone made posts on both those sites claiming to be able to decrypt hard disks infected with the malware in exchange for a payment of 100 bitcoins.The £200,000 offer has created more uncertainty about the motivations behind the ransomware. While it originally appeared to be created with the intention of earning a lot of money through ransom payments, researchers quickly pointed out that a number of features of the software made it appear that the ransom element was a smokescreen, with the real goal being widespread damage.Significantly, the majority of infections occurred in Ukraine, due to the main attack vector being a compromised version of an accounting program, ME Doc, used to file taxes in the nation. That has led to many, including the Ukrainian government, suspecting Russian involvement as part of the ongoing cyberwar between the two countries.Hackers offering to decrypt files for money suggests that the cash motivation may be more significant than thought ? but that too could be misdirection.While the hackers continue to play games, the Ukrainian cybercrime unit is continuing its investigation. On Wednesday, it announced that it had seized ME Doc?s servers after ?new activity? was detected there, and said it had acted to ?immediately stop the uncontrolled proliferation? of malware.Cyber police spokeswoman Yulia Kvitko suggested that ME Doc had sent or was preparing to send a new update and added that swift action had prevented any further damage. ?Our experts stopped (it) on time,? she said.It wasn?t immediately clear how or why hackers might still have access to ME Doc?s servers. The company has not returned messages from reporters, but in several statements took to Facebook to dispute allegations that its poor security helped seed the malware epidemic.Cyber police chief Coonel Serhiy Demydiuk previously said that ME Doc?s owners would be brought to justice, but Kvitko said there had been no arrests."

In language lifted almost word-for-word from its previous iterations, the latest report said, ?Pakistan did not take sufficient action against other externally focused groups, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad in 2016, which continued to operate, train, organise, and fundraise in Pakistan.?The report stated further, ?The Pakistani military and security forces undertook operations against groups that conducted attacks within Pakistan such as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (but they) did not take substantial action against the Afghan Taliban or HQN (Haqqani network), or substantially limit their ability to threaten US interests in Afghanistan??As before, Pakistan figured on the list of countries in the report that the US says provide safe haven to terrorist groups such as Haqqani Network, LeT and JeM. ?Although LeT is banned in Pakistan,? it said, ?LeT?s wings Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation (FiF) were able to openly engage in fundraising, including in the capital,? it said. The report said Indian authorities continued to blame Pakistan for cross-border attacks in Jammu and Kashmir. ?In January, India experienced a terrorist attack against an Indian military facility in Pathankot, Punjab, which was blamed by authorities on JeM,? the report said. Worldwide, the Islamic State remained ?the most potent terrorist threat to global security?, the report said, ?with eight recognised branches and numerous undeclared networks operating beyond the group?s core concentration in Iraq and Syria?.And, the report added, ?Iran remained the foremost state sponsor of terrorism in 2016 as groups supported by Iran maintained their capability to threaten US interests and allies.? Read |?US looks to cut aid to Pakistan, other client nations in coming budgetIn terms of the number of terrorist attacks, an appendix prepared for the state department by an outside body found a dip. ?The total number of terrorist attacks in 2016 decreased by 9% and total deaths due to terrorist attacks decreased by 13%, compared to 2015. This was largely due to fewer attacks and deaths in Afghanistan, Syria, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Yemen.?The observations on Pakistan were almost the same as observations in the country reports for 2015, for instance, reflecting a continuity from the previous Obama administration that had in August 2016 punished Pakistan for its patchy counter-terrorism by withholding $300 million in defence aid.Earlier that year, the US Senate had come together in a bipartisan effort to kill a proposal for a subsidised sale of eight new F-17 combat jets to Pakistan for exactly the same reason ? not acting resolutely enough against terrorists based on its soil.The Trump administration has already indicated its views on Pakistan?s counter-terrorism efforts are no different. National Security Adviser HR McMaster delivered that message directly to the Pakistani leadership during a visit to Islamabad in April, emphasising ?the need to confront terrorism in all its forms?.President Donald Trump has personally not weighed in on this yet, but his remarks on Twitter from 2012 may point to his thinking: ?Get it straight. Pakistan is not our friend? When will Pakistan apologize to us for providing safe sanctuary to Osama Bin Laden for 6 years?! Some ?ally?.? "

"An exit poll conducted by India Today-Axis My India has predicted 202-220 seats for BJP in the 272-ward MCD. The BJP is in power in MCD for the past ten years. The exit poll has further predicted 23-35 seats for AAP and 19-31 seats for Congress.

The survey places the Aam Aadmi Party, which rules Delhi assembly, and the Congress trailing behind with a huge margin.Of the total 272 wards in the national Capital, the BJP is expected to win 202-220 seats while AAP and Congress 23-35 and 19-31 respectively, according to the poll survey. The voting percentage reflected in the polls give 43 per cent share to the saffron outfit while the AAP and Congress are almost equally placed at 24 and 23 per cent in the MCDs.The BJP lead is evenly spread in all three wards. The North MCD, which has 104 wards, is expected to give the BJP 78-84 seats, with AAP and Congress getting 8-12 each. Similarly, the 104-seat North MCD gives the BJP 79-85 seats. The AAP is placed somewhere between 9 and13 wards while the Congress at 7-11.The smaller East MCD, which has 64 wards, is expected to give the BJP 45-51 seats while the Congress 4-8 and the AAP 6-10.'POLL RESULTS ACCORDING TO OUR EXPECTATIONS'""Exit poll results are according to our expectations,"" state BJP president Manoj Tiwari told Mail Today. Attributing the positive survey results to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Tiwari said, ""PM Modi has won hearts of people from sections of society. The BJP has taken all its decisions for welfare of India while the AAP has looted citizens of Delhi.""Tiwari said exit polls results prove while the Congress has lost ground across the nation, there is simmering discontent and anger among Delhi electorate against CM Kejriwal.The survey results also indicate that the BJP has made new inroads in the national Capital, with the last-minute change in state leadership with an extra emphasis on poorvanchali voters having paid off rich dividends. The exit poll has predicted that 45 per cent of the poorvanchali vote went in favour of BJP.This section of voters was a key target of the party when they handed over the reins of city unit to Manoj Tiwari in November last year.The recent by-election results in Rajouri Garden assembly segment too proved this when the BJP's poll percentage in the constituency increased from 38 per cent in 2015 to 52 per cent in 2017. The seat saw a sharp decline of nearly 34 per cent in the vote share of incumbent AAP from 47 per cent in 2015 to 13.1 in 2017. In previous several elections, the party's vote share had remained between 30 and 35 per cent in the national Capital.While AAP leaders were quick to point out anomalies in electronic voting machines, they were at pains to explain how an exit poll survey, which is gauged out of speaking to a voter exiting the election booth, can be linked with faulty EVMs.Congress leaders advised patience till April 26 when the counting occurs. ""These (polls) violate moral code of conduct. The results will come on 26. Let us wait till then,"" Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed said. The exit polls also indicate that the BJP has succeeded in making a dent in SC/ST and OBC votes in the national Capital.

"While talking about the human shield controversy, Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat said on Sunday, soldiers need ""innovative ways"" to fight the ""dirty war"" in Kashmir.

""This is a proxy war and proxy war is a dirty war. It is played in a dirty way. The rules of engagements are there when the adversary comes face-to-face and fights with you. It is a dirty war.... That is where innovation comes in. You fight a dirty war with innovations,"" Rawat told PTI.""People are throwing stones at us, people are throwing petrol bombs at us. If my men ask me what do we do, should I say, just wait and die? I will come with a nice coffin with a national flag and I will send your bodies home with honour. Is it what I am supposed to tell them as chief? I have to maintain the morale of my troops who are operating there,"" Gen Rawat said.Rawat went on to indicate that stone pelters had complicated the security situation in Kashmir, saying his force would find it easier to quell protests if instead of stones, weapons were used.  ""In fact, I wish these people, instead of throwing stones at us, were firing weapons at us. Then I would have been happy. Then I could do what I (want to do),"" Rawat told PTI.Saying that the Army cannot run away from its role to provide security, Rawat said, ""Tomorrow elections have to be held in Anantnag and similar things may happen. If the army does not respond to call for assistance, then the trust between the people whom we are protecting, police and army will break."" ""That is something I cannot allow to happen. This is what the militants want. It can create a divide between the army and other security forces,"" he said.'NEED TO FEAR THE ARMY'He added that the Indian Army is a friendly force and is practising maximum restraint to deal with the Kashmir situation. Rawat noted that the force can only do its job if the country fears it. ""Adversaries must be afraid of you and at the same time your people must be afraid of you. We are a friendly army, but when we are called to restore law and order, people have to be afraid of us,"" he said.Rawat also spoke about the core issue of Kashmir, saying that it is something that needs a composite solution and is a process in which everybody will have to get involved. ""It will have to be a composite solution. Everybody will have to get involved. Army's role is to ensure that violence does not take place and the common man who is not indulging in this (violence) is protected,"" he said, when asked about the solution to the Kashmir issue.HUMAN SHIELD CONTROVERSY The Army chief's statements come days after Major Leetul Gogoi of the 53 Rashtriya Rifles was awarded a Commendation Card by General Rawat for the former's role in countering insurgency in Kashmir.In his PTI interview, Rawat said that Gogoi's commendation was awarded with the aim of boosting the morale of his troops. ""As Army Chief my concern is morale of the Army. That is my job. I am far away from the battle field. I cannot influence the situation there. I can only tell the boys that I am with you. I always tell my people, things will go wrong, but if things have gone wrong and you did not have malafide intent, I am there,"" he said.Major Gogoi is the same officer who sparked nationwide controversy after tying a Kashmiri local to an Army jeep. Gogoi, in a statement delivered recently, said his actions were aimed at saving the lives of the men under his command as well as those of stone pelters in Kashmir. On April 9, the day of polling for the Srinagar Parliamentary bypoll, Major Gogoi and his team were called to the Utligam polling both to rescue civilian and security personnel trapped at the location. Major Gogoi said that around 1,200 protesters had surrounded the booth and in order to escape from the booth, with the people he had just rescued, he grabbed a person he believed to be the ring leader of the protesters and got him tied to a jeep. The man - Farooq Ahmad Dar - has denied that he was a stone pelter. Gogoi and his team then drove the jeep with Dar tied to it out of the area. A video of the incident, shared by former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, went viral on social media and caused a huge controversy, forcing the Army to set up a Court of Inquiry into the incident. Sources previously told India Today that the CoI has not found Major Gogoi to be at fault. Gogoi continues to serve the Rashtriya Rifles unit.However, Rawat told PTI he has a general idea about what is going on in the Court of Inquiry and that is why he went ahead with awarding the Major. ""I know what is happening in the COI. It is being finalised. What do we punish him for.""UNREST IN KASHMIRRawat's comments come amid concerns of widespread unrest in the Kashmir Valley following Saturday's killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Sabzar Ahmad Bhat. Bhat, the successor of Burhan Wani, was killed on Saturday in an Indian Army operation. Wani's death had sparked months of violent unrest in Kashmir leading to the deaths of more than 100 civilians. Officials have however expressed confidence that a repeat of the post-Wani violence won't happen as the establishment is prepared to deal with stone pelters. "

"The National Green Tribunal-appointed committee of experts has found Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's Art of Living (AoL) responsible for destroying Yamuna floodplains, where its World Culture Festival was hosted last year. Further, the panel found that the rehabilitation of the floodplains destroyed by the event will take 10 years and cost over ?13 crore.","summarize: The damage to the Yamuna floodplains caused by the Art of Living?s three-day cultural festival last year will cost more than Rs 42 crore and at least 10 years to fix, according to the expert panel appointed by the National Green Tribunal.The Foundation has, however, called the committee biased and acting with vested interests.The expert panel, headed by Shashi Shekhar, secretary of ministry of water resources, submitted its report to the NGT on Wednesday, on damage assessment following the Art of Living?s three-day World Culture Festival in March 2016.The panel has suggested a time-bound action plan, which comprises two components - physical and biological rehabilitation. The physical component is estimated to cost around Rs 28.73 crore and the biological part would cost around Rs 13.29 crore.?In addition to this, there would be expenditure for the monitoring by a team of experts for 10 years and the cost of transportation of material outside the floodplain,? said an expert.The 47-page report estimates that approximately 120 hectares (about 300 acres) of floodplains of west (right bank) of the river Yamuna and about 50 hectares (120 acres) floodplains of the eastern side (left bank) of the river have been adversely impacted ecologically at different magnitudes.The Art of Living spokesperson, however, has alleged ?bias beyond doubt.??The Expert Committee members of the NGT who were supposed to be non-interested parties to the case and were to act as the eyes and ears of judges have given biased interviews in public while the case is sub-judice... The closeness of the petitioner with the expert committee members was not disclosed to us when it was appointed by NGT and went into the preparation of the report,? said Kedar Desai, the spokesperson.Desai said the Art of Living Foundation is a ?responsible and environmentally sensitive NGO? and its legal team will be looking into the report to decide on the appropriate future action.The NGT had allowed the festival in March 2016, saying that as the matter was ?fait accompli?, they could not ban it. The three-day World Cultural Festival soon grabbed headlines for allegedly polluting and damaging the Yamuna floodplain ecosystem.The NGT slapped an interim fine Rs 5 crore on the Foundation for environmental damage while efforts were made to ascertain the exact costs of the damage.An initial four-member committee had recommended that the Foundation pay Rs100 to Rs 120 crores as compensation for the restoration work.The green court had later asked an expert panel of seven members to estimate the damage to the floodplains and how much it would cost to fix these damages. This committee observed that the festival had ?completely destroyed, not simply damaged? the riverfront area between DND flyover and the Barapulla drain, which had served as the main event site.?The ground is now totally levelled, compacted and hardened and is totally devoid of water bodies or depressions and almost completely devoid of any vegetation.?Huge amount of earth and debris have been dumped to construct the ramps for access from the DND flyover and from the two pontoon bridges across the Barapulla drain,? the report said.It said the floodplain was severely harmed and ?almost all its natural vegetation? was lost, affecting the natural habitat of a large number animals, insects and other organisms."

"The Indian Railways is exploring self-propelled train sets similar to those used in the Delhi Metro, senior officials have said. Experts claim the technology will achieve faster acceleration of up to 160 km per hour and feature advanced protective measures like electro-pneumatic braking systems. A prototype, currently under construction, will begin trial runs next year. ","summarize: Racing against time to bring a network of ""high-speed corridors"" on track, the Indian Railways is exploring self-propelled train sets similar to those used in Delhi Metro.This technology, experts say, will not only achieve faster acceleration of up to 160 km per hour, but also put in place advance protective measures like electro-pneumatic braking system to improve passenger safety.Senior railway officials said the prototype of the train is being manufactured at Integral Coach Factory in Chennai and the first two sets will be ready by March 2018. The trial runs will begin soon thereafter.A top railway ministry official told Mail Today that the Chennai coach factory has already issued a global tender for technical support for the new trains. MADE IN INDIA""These self-propelled trains will be made in India. This will reduce the manufacturing cost to nearly half the cost of importing them from foreign countries. Apart from the passenger comfort, emphasis will be on safety of the trains while they run at high speed,"" the official said.The Chennai factory is looking to equip the train sets with improved mechanical couplers and modern bogies that will support its movement at high speed. ""This will help keep the jerks and vibrations at bay,"" officials associated with the project said.""The train will have fully suspended traction motors, pneumatic secondary suspension and anti-roll bar. The brake system will be Electro Pneumatic, which will reduce the braking distance, so that full speed potential of the train can be harnessed,"" the officials said.The new technology, which comprises electro-pneumatic (EP) brake system, has an edge over the conventional air brake mechanism in terms of speed of control and quick on-vehicle reaction times.The EP brake takes less time to respond giving the loco pilot instant control of the entire train. Experts said it was originally designed for subways or metro trains but over the years the system has been widely used in leading train networks across the globe. Its speed of operation also makes it ideal for automatic train operation (ATO).For operating trains at the speed of 160 km per hour, the biggest challenge before railways is to modify its existing tracks. This includes removing sharp curves and barricading along the route so that trains can attain high speed without any physical obstructions.MODI'S DREAM PROJECTA network of high speed corridors is the dream project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi but so far only Delhi-Agra corridor has become operational. Gatimaan Express, India's fastest train that runs at the speed of 160 km per hour, runs on the corridor.Eight other semi-high speed corridors have been proposed across the country but these are still in the conception stage. Railways has also formed a separate entity, High Speed Rail Corporation (HSRC) for speedy execution of these projects.The railways has also started the work to convert two of the busiest routes -- Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Howrah -- into semi-high speed corridors. The maximum speed of trains on these rail routes will increase by 30 km per hour that will cut short the travel time to Mumbai and Kolkata by up to 5 hours.As per the plan, the top speed of Rajdhani Express on these routes will be increased from the current 130 kmph to 160 kmph. Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu has instructed railway officials to execute the two projects on priority basis."

A bench of justices directed the government to pay him within 45 days, failing which it would have to shell out interest at the rate of 12% a year.","summarize:  The Bombay high court has granted compensation of Rs2lakh to a 63-year-old murder convict from Aurangabad because he was kept in jail for three years and nine months beyond his sentence. A division bench of justices TV Nalawade and Sunil Kotwal directed the government to pay the amount to Ranjitsingh Gill within 45 days, failing which it would have to shell out interest at the rate of 12% a year. Gill was arrested in August 1975 on murder charges. He was acquitted by a trial court but the Bombay high court overturned the order and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The high court order was later upheld by the Supreme Court. After serving 17 years and nine months in jail, Gill was released in February 2002. Two years later, he approached the high court, seeking compensation of Rs25 lakh on the grounds that he was illegally detained for three years and nine months beyond the term of his sentence. Though the court agreed that section 433A (giving powers to state to commute or remit sentence)?of the Criminal Procedure Code, which came into effect three years after his conviction, was not applicable in this case, it said that the government had failed to release him on time. ?This court holds that compensation needs to be paid to the petitioner,? ruled the court. ?On the date he submitted his petition, the petitioner was about 50-year-old and it can be said that he lost more than three years of his active life owing to the illegal detention,? said the bench. ?When a person is kept behind bars, his entire family suffers.

"The Delhi High Court on Tuesday stayed the AAP government's nursery admission norm, which made it mandatory for private unaided schools to accept admission forms based on the neighbourhood criteria. Justice Manmohan termed the notification as ""arbitrary, unreasonable and against public interest."" The notification gave priority to people living within a radius of 1 kilometre from the school. ","summarize: The Delhi high court on Tuesday stayed a controversial nursery admission notification by the AAP government that made 298 private unaided schools, built on public land, to accept admission forms based only on the neighbourhood or distance criteria.Justice Manmohan termed the notification as ?arbitrary, unreasonable and against the public interest? before ordering a stay on its application on the private unaided schools for this year?s nursery admission process.Earlier, the court had directed the private schools to accept applications based on their own criteria as well as city administration guidelines. Tuesday?s order will give the schools a free hand to admit toddlers using their own criteria.?State cannot impose a restriction on choice of parents to choose a school for their wards just because it is beneficial for the child,? justice Manmohan remarked.Around 150,000 aspirants vie for 125,000 seats every year but the process gets caught in last-minute litigation as either parents or schools go to court almost every year.The court also questioned the city government?s decision to impose the neighbourhood restriction to only those schools that are built on Delhi Development Authority land.?Public interest cannot be confined to 298 schools,? justice Manmohan remarked adding, ?primary cause of nursery admission chaos is the lack of good schools in the capital?.The court?s order came on pleas by the Action Committee for Unaided Recognised Private Schools ? comprising more than 450 private unaided recognised schools in Delhi ? and the Forum for Promotion of Quality Education and some parents challenging the government?s January 7 notification.The notification gave priority to those living within a radius of 1 kilometre. In case seats remained vacant, those living within a 3-kilometre radius could get a chance. Which meant these schools could no longer deny admission to anyone from the neighbourhood.Earlier, the high court stayed city government?s controversial nursery admission notification that made it mandatory for private unaided minority schools to admit students, in the unreserved category, on the basis of neighbourhood criteria.The order gave relief to around 15 minority schools in the capital that were set up on public land."

"A swarm of bees reportedly attacked a Hyderabad-Pune flight last week and delayed it by almost an hour. The flight was able to take off only after a repellent spray was used to clear the insects from the area. ""We will look into the matter and necessary action will be taken,"" a Directorate General of Civil Aviation official said. ","summarize: After a swarm of bees held up a Hyderabad-Pune flight last week for more than one hour, the country aviation regulator said it will investigate how a bee hive was allowed to flourish in the airport area. The flight on July 26 was held up when the ATR?72 - a short-haul aircraft - was besieged by bees. The flight, which was scheduled to take off at around 6.25pm, took off only at around 7.22pm after a repellent spray was used to clear the insects from the apron area. This was the first such incident in the past five years.  A Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) official on Monday said, ?We will look into the matter and necessary action will be taken.? Air India spokesperson, Dhananjay Kumar, confirmed the incident and said that taking safety as priority, the pilot took necessary precautions before taking off the flight. ?The swarms of bees kept coming and settling on the wind screen of the cockpit, not allowing the pilot to push back,? he explained.The incident took place when the flight was to line up for its scheduled take off. The Flight 9I 867 of Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Air India, couldn?t push back when a group of bees surrounded the twin engine turboprop. Though the aircraft?s door was shut to stop bees from entering it, the pilot got in touch with the Air Traffic Control (ATC) who in turn informed the airport operator. The pilot had to then call for a spray in order to get rid of the bees. Commenting on the incident, Captain Mohan Ranganathan, aviation safety expert, said, ?Bees do not pose a threat to the ATR but the engineers and other ground staff who play a major role before take-off would  have found it impossible to perform their functions due to their presence.? Pilots said that the bee hives shouldn?t be in the airport premises as part of the air safety measures taken in the airport.

"Mohit Goel, Director of Noida-based Ringing Bells, which claimed to make world's cheapest smartphone Freedom 251, was detained on Thursday over allegations of fraud. Goel was detained after Freedom 251 distributor Ayam Enterprises filed an FIR alleging it had been ""defrauded"" of ?16 lakh. In December 2016, Ringing Bells officials were summoned in a cheque bounce case worth ?2 crore.","summarize: Police has detained Mohit Goel, the director of Ringing Bells, the company behind's last year Freedom 251 phone for alleged fraud. Goel was held after Ghaziabad-based Ayam Enterprises filed an FIR on Wednesday alleging that Ringing Bells ""defrauded"" it of Rs 16 lakh.Last year Ringing Bells had created a sensation after it announced Freedom 251, a smartphone that it promised to sell at a price of Rs 251. The company took pre-orders from hundreds of thousands of people. However, so far it has failed to deliver the phones to most of these people who had pre-booked the device.Ghaziabad deputy SP Manish Mishra said Goel has been detained for interrogation in the matter.In the FIR, Ayam Enterprises has claimed it was persuaded by Goel and others from Ringing Bells to take up the distributorship of the Freedom 251 phones in November 2015.""We paid Rs 30 lakh to Ringing Bells through RTGS on different occasions. But it delivered us product worth Rs 13 lakh only. Upon follow-up, we could get products plus money totalling Rs 14 lakh,"" it claimed in the FIR.The owners of Ayam Enterprises claim that they were threatened with life if they asked for the rest Rs 16 lakh ""again and again"".The Freedom 251 looked like a scam since very beginning. The phone was seemingly a re-branded Chinese phone that was picked up at a price of a few thousand rupees from Chinese market. However, these units were just the display units. Ringing Bells never showed that it had the ability to manufacture or even import hundreds of thousands of phones to supply them to all those people who pre-booked it."
"A pornographic video was played on an LED screen installed at Delhi Metro's Rajiv Chowk station, according to footage recently surfaced online. The incident happened on April 9 wherein the video lasted for nearly a minute. Claiming that the screen was under commissioning and testing by a private contractor, the Delhi Metro has initiated a probe into the matter.","summarize: Commuters at the busy Rajiv Chowk Metro station in central Delhi?s Connaught Place were left shocked when a pornographic clip played on an LED screen for around 10 minutes.The screen, that was installed on April 9 and is meant to display advertisements, started playing a porn video all of a sudden, eyewitnesses said. The video continued for several minutes and was stopped only after some commuters brought it to the attention of DMRC officials at the station.The incident was recorded by several commuters on their mobile phones and has been shared multiple times on various social media platforms, forcing the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to initiate an inquiry. DMRC said three unidentified men may have played the clip on the big screen as the system is not secure.Anuj Dayal, the DMRC spokesperson, said after preliminary investigations, it has been established that the incident took place around 5pm on April 9. ?The LED TV system was being commissioned and its Wi-Fi port was accessible. Prima facie, as per CCTV footage, three men played the porn clip through their mobile (phone) on this TV at Rajiv Chowk station. Attempts are being made to identify these men. CCTV footage is under examination to identify the culprits,? said Dayal.?This sort of interference with the system will not be possible in the future once the software is programmed and centrally controlled. In the interim, during the commissioning process, the contractor will be advised to ensure password protection,? Dayal added.A video of the area, recorded by a commuter, showed most people walk past the screen either clueless or unbothered. A few others, however, stopped by to record the unusual activity on their mobile phones. A few of them then alerted the DMRC officials who rushed into action to turn off the broadcast.Delhi Police, meanwhile, said they have not received any complaint from the DMRC in this connection. ?If the DMRC approaches us after completing their internal probe, we will go ahead with the legal proceedings,? said a senior police officer.?The objective of the LED screens is to disseminate information to passengers through various multimedia tools,? said another DMRC spokesperson.A similar incident had been reported from Wayanad district in Kerala in 2015. Hundreds of passengers waiting at a bus stand in Kalpetta then had seen a porn video playing on a television installed to broadcast advertisements. A witness had later shared the video of the spot on social media. The user reported that the clip had played for 30 minutes . Some passengers then had tried covering the TV set with a cloth while women and children chose to walk away from the spot."

He was 89.Landau died Saturday of unexpected complications during a short stay at UCLA Medical Centre, his publicist Dick Guttman said.Mission: Impossible, which also starred Landau?s wife, Barbara Bain, became an immediate hit upon its debut in 1966.

						Landau might have been a superstar but for a role he didn?t play - the pointy-eared starship Enterprise science officer, Mr. Spock. Star Trek creator Gene Rodenberry had offered him the half-Vulcan, half-human who attempts to rid his life of all emotion. Landau turned it down.?A character without emotions would have driven me crazy; I would have had to be lobotomized,? he explained in 2001. Instead, he chose Mission: Impossible, and Leonard Nimoy went on to everlasting fame as Spock.Ironically, Nimoy replaced Landau on Mission: Impossible.After a brief but impressive Broadway career, Landau had made an auspicious film debut in the late 1950s, playing a soldier in Pork Chop Hill and a villain in the Alfred Hitchcock classic North By Northwest.He enjoyed far less success after Mission: Impossible, however, finding he had been typecast as Rollin Hand, the top-secret mission team?s disguise wizard.

"Raveena Tandon's 'Maatr' which released on Friday, ""is successful...in how it approaches rape as it doesn't trivialise the subject,"" wrote Hindustan Times. ""Maatr a drama with too many blows but little depth,"" said India Today. TOI wrote, ""Raveena's sincere as the victim who sullies her hands to get justice."" It was rated 3/5 (TOI), 2/5 (HT) 1.5/5 (India Today).","summarize: Director: Ashtar Sayed Cast: Raveena Tandon, Madhur Mittal, Divya Jagdale, Anurag Arora, Rushad RanaRating:  (1.5/5) Not Without My Daughter, Taken, The Brave One are just some of the Hollywood thrillers that come to mind when sitting through Maatr, a revenge drama, in which a traumatised mother takes the law into her own hands and tracks down the killers. But writer Michael Pellico throws in Indian references to in the Mahabharata and the brutal gangrape which is reminiscent of the Nirbhaya case. For all its grittiness, Maatr is barely able to skim the surface of a woman's paranoia unlike Pink, another drama about sexual assault which is set in the capital.Raveena Tandon plays Vidya, a teacher, who witnesses her bright daughter's brutal rape and subsequent demise. She is a bruised, battered victim herself but the makers pretty much sideline Vidya's trauma to focus on her grief. Here too one of the perpetrators is a man with influence, in this case it's the bratty son (Madhur Mittal of Slumdog Millionaire) of the Chief Minister. This is one of the earlier signs that in Maatr playing out extremities is more important than allowing moments of reflection and empathy. When justice is out of her reach (""it's not like filter coffee that you get it instantly""), Vidya with a little help of Facebook, Google Maps, email, drugs and a gun plots the death of the seven accused. While some are well-executed, most are a bit sudden and haphazard. The latter makes the film occasionally germane and at times improbable. Tandon does well as the more amateurish Liam Neeson but one wishes for more context to her character instead of just a well-coiffed, vengeful, death magnet of a mother. Little time is devoted to her doomed marriage with an inconsiderate husband who blames her poor navigation skills for the tragedy. As the sole witness of the murder and survivor she is also surprisingly given too much free reign to execute her plan. Another minor sexual assault victim is included to heighten the anger, but in Maatr this seems more a lazy plot convenience. As the clock approaches the hour mark, Sayed raises the violence quotient adding kicks and punches to the action but the blows don't quite have the emotional impact. Maatr despite the gravity of the theme is a subpar drama. The film would have been more effective if the mawkish, flashback-heavy songs were skipped. Maatr is a missed opportunity to make a powerful statement against India's poor track record in dispensing justice and tackling violence against women. Revenge is a dish best served cold; in Maatr it's crass and oddly flat too. "

"Over 60 retired IAS and IPS officers have written an open letter to the Narendra Modi government asking it to enforce the rule of law and not allow vigilantism to grow. ""Gau rakshaks function with impunity and seem to be doing so with the tacit complicity or active encouragement of state machinery,"" the ex-bureaucrats said.","summarize: Over 60 retired IAS and IPS officers have written an open letter to the Narendra Modi government asking it to enforce the rule of law and not allow vigilantism to grow. The open letter has been signed by 65 officers including noted former bureaucrats Bhaskar Ghose, Harsh Mandar and Wajahat Habibullah. The former administrators are particularly unhappy with the way self-appointed cow vigilantes are going around, attacking and lynching people in the name of protecting the animal. Majority of such attacks in recent past have had communal overtones.They ex-bureaucrats said, ""Gau-rakshaks function with impunity and seem to be doing so with the tacit complicity or active encouragement of state machinery.""The letter was written on June 24. However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed his 'anger' against cow vigilantism since then at public meeting in Gujarat.Speaking at Sabaramati Ashram on Thursday, Prime Minister Modi warned those ""taking law in their hands in the name of protection of cows."" 'INTOLERANCE EVERYWHERE'They also expressed deep concern over growing intolerance in the universities across the country. They said, ""Student groups and faculty members on campuses like Hyderabad and JNU, who raise troubling questions about equality, social justice and freedom, are subject to attack by the administration, with a supportive government to back them.""The retired top officials are also critical of the Centre's action against the NGOs for violating foreign contribution laws.

We should make it clear that as a group, we have no affiliation with any political party but believe in the credo of impartiality, neutrality and commitment to the Indian constitution. A sense of deep disquiet at what has been happening in India has prompted us to write this open letter to chronicle our reservations and misgivings about recent developments in the body politic. What has gone wrong?It appears as if there is a growing climate of religious intolerance that is aimed primarily at Muslims. In Uttar Pradesh, in the run-up to the elections, an odious and frankly communal comparison was made between the relative number of burial grounds and cremation grounds. The question was also asked as to whether electricity was being supplied equally to different communities during their religious festivals. All this without any basis in fact or evidence. The banning of slaughter-houses targets the minorities and affects their livelihoods as well. Such intolerance breeds violence in a communally charged atmosphere-even to the extent of a local leader in UP provoking an attack upon the residence of a Superintendent of Police, whose family was terrorised.Vigilantism has become widespread. An Akhlaq is killed on the basis of a suspicion that the meat he has is beef and a Pehlu Khan is lynched while transporting to his place two cows he had bought and for which he had the necessary papers. Nomadic shepherds are attacked in Jammu and Kashmir on some suspicion as they practice their age-old occu-pation of moving from one place to another along with their cattle and belongings. Punitive action against the perpetrators of violence does not take place promptly but cruelly, the victims have FIRs registered against them. The behaviour of vigilantes-who act as if they are prosecutor, judge and executioner rolled into one-flies in the face of law and juris-prudence. These actions undermine the rule of law and the Indian Constitution since only the state-through its various organs and insti-tutions-has the power to enforce the law.Vigilantism has become popular as 'anti-Romeo' squads threaten young couples who go out together, hold hands and are perhaps in love with each other. A thinly-veiled effort to prevent a Hindu-Muslim relationship or marriage, there is no justification in law to harass these couples, particularly when there is no complaint from the woman of being ill-treated.Student groups and faculty members on campuses like Hyderabad and JNU, who raise troubling questions about equality, social justice and freedom, are subject to attack by the administration, with a supportive government to back them. In Jodhpur, a planned lecture by a renowned academic was cancelled under pressure and the faculty that organised the event subjected to disciplinary action. What happened in Jodhpur has happened at other institutions as well. Argumentation and discussion about different perspectives-the life-blood not only of institutions of learning but of democracy itself-are being throttled. Disagree-ment and dissent are considered seditious and anti-national. Such attitudes have a chilling impact on free speech and thought.Several reputed NGOs and civil society organisations are being charged with violating the provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act and the Income Tax Act. While we agree that genuine violators should be identified and penalised, we note with dismay that several of the targeted groups are those who have taken stands against government policies, expressed dissent or supported communities in cases against the state.We are also seeing an ugly trend of trolling, threats and online intimidation of activists, journalists, writers and intellectuals who disagree with the dominant ideology. How does this square with free speech?There is a growing hyper-nationalism that reduces any critique to a binary: if you are not with the government, you are anti-national. Those in authority should not be questioned- that is the clear message.In the face of a rising authoritarianism and majoritarianism, which do not allow for reasoned debate, discussion and dissent, we appeal to all public authorities, public institutions and constitutional bodies to take heed of these disturbing trends and take corrective action. We have to reclaim and defend the spirit of the Constitution of India, as envisaged by the founding fathers.(Inputs from Seemi Pasha in New Delhi) ALSO READ| Story of lynching: Kashmir to Haryana, how hate crime thrives in absence of lawSrinagar: DSP Ayyub Pandith beaten to death by mob outside Jamia Masjid"

"China on Monday responded to India's statement saying it is also different from the China of 1962. ""[T]o some extent he is right in saying India in 2017 is different from India in 1962, just like China is also different,"" said a spokesperson. China has also claimed that India is using ""excuse of Bhutan's interests to infringe upon China's territory"".","summarize: Responding to Defence Minister Arun Jaitley's statement to India Today saying India in 2017 was different from 1962, Beijing retorted on Monday that ""to some extent he is right in saying India in 2017 is different from India in 1962, just like China is also different"".China's statement came as it stepped up its claims on India ""trespassing"" at the Sikkim border.On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry claimed that India was ""using the excuse of Bhutan's interests to infringe upon China's territory"" and suggested India had sent its troops into Bhutan without the latter's permission.""The Bhutan side does not know previously that Indian troops entered Doklam which is not in line with what India claims,"" said spokesperson Geng Shuang, contradicting India's Friday statement that the Royal Bhutan Army had on June 16 protested the PLA's construction activities in Doklam, with the Indian Army two days later supporting Bhutan and asking China to stop altering the status quo.China's Foreign Ministry also said that Jawaharlal Nehru ""explicitly recognised"" the 1890 Sikkim-Tibet treaty that Beijing is now citing to back its territorial claims.In the very same March 22, 1959 letter, Nehru also reminded China of an 1842 treaty on Ladakh and the drawing of the McMahon line in Simla in 1914, which aren't recognised by China. Citing the 1890 convention which fixes the India-China-Bhutan trijunction at Gipmochi, far south of where India and Bhutan do, the Foreign Ministry said the ""illegal trespass of border troops goes against convention and is against basic principles of the UN Charter and international laws"".""The action taken by India is undoubtedly a betrayal of consistent position held by India,"" said Geng, adding that ""Prime Minister Nehru explicitly recognised the 1890 convention between Tibet and Sikkim"" in a March 22, 1959 letter to then Chinese PM Zhou Enlai.India maintains the 1890 agreement only provides the basis of alignment of the boundary, and that the border needs to be finalised by the Special Representatives in maps and on the ground.NEHRU'S LETTER READIn the letter Geng cited, Nehru wrote that ""The boundary of Sikkim, a protectorate of India, with the Tibet Region of China was defined in the Anglo- Chinese Convention 1890 and jointly demarcated on the ground in 1895.""However, in the same letter, Nehru also mentioned agreements on the boundaries in Ladakh and Arunachal, which China now rejects.In fact, in the very same section of the letter, Nehru mentioned the following two agreements: ""The Ladakh Region of the State of Jammu and Kashmir- A treaty of 1842 between Kashmir on the one hand and the Emperor of China and Lama Guru of Lhasa on the other, mentions the India-China boundary in the Ladakh region. In 1847 the Chinese Government admitted that this boundary was sufficiently and distinctly fixed. The area now claimed by China has always been depicted as part of India on official maps, has been surveyed by Indian officials and even a Chinese map of shows it as Indian territory.""On the McMahon Line, Nehru wrote: ""The McMahon Line-As you are aware, the so-called McMahon Line runs eastwards from the eastern borders of Bhutan and defines the boundary of China on the one hand and on the India and Burma on the other. Contrary to what has been reported to you, this line was, in fact, drawn at a Tripartite Conference held at Simla in 1913-1914 between the Plenipotentiaries of the Governments of China, Tibet and India. At the time of acceptance of the delineation of this frontier, Lonchen Shatra, the Tibetan Plenipotentiary, in letters exchanged, stated explicitly that he had received orders from Lhasa to agree to the boundary as marked on the map appended to the Convention.""

"Experts who exhumed late artist Salvador Dalí's body have revealed his moustache remains intact, nearly three decades after his death. Narcís Bardalet said, ""His moustache is still intact, (like clock hands at) 10 past 10, just as he liked it."" His body was exhumed to settle a paternity case, wherein a woman claimed her mother and Dali had an affair.","summarize: Experts who exhumed the body of Salvador Dalí to collect samples for use in a paternity claim have revealed that the enigmatic artist?s trademark moustache still graces his face almost three decades after he died.Narcís Bardalet, the embalmer who tended Dalí?s body after his death in 1989 and helped with the exhumation on Thursday night, said he had been delighted to see the surrealist?s best-known feature once again.?His moustache is still intact, [like clock hands at] 10 past 10, just as he liked it. It?s a miracle,? he told the Catalan radio station RAC1.Dalí is buried in a crypt beneath the museum he designed for himself in his home town of Figueres, Catalonia. His remains were disinterred to help settle a long-running paternity claim from a 61-year-old fortune-teller who insists she is his only child.Bardalet described the moment he had laid eyes on Dalí. ?His face was covered with a silk handkerchief ? a magnificent handkerchief,? he told RAC1.?When it was removed, I was delighted to see his moustache was intact ? I was quite moved. You could also see his hair.?He said Dali?s body resembled ?a mummy; it was like wood?, adding that it was so hard that experts had to use an electric saw rather than a scalpel to collect bone samples. Bardalet predicted Dalí?s body would last a good while longer. ?The moustache is still there and will be for centuries,? he said.Once the last visitors of the day had left the museum, the 1.5-tonne stone slab that rests above his grave was lifted so experts could get to his body to take hair, nails and two large bones.?The biological specimens have been taken from Salvador Dalí?s remains,? Catalonia?s high court said in a statement before midnight local time.It said Dali?s coffin had been opened at 10.20pm so work could begin.To guard the artist?s posthumous privacy, awnings were put up around the museum to stop drones recording the exhumation.The DNA recovered from the remains will be compared with samples from Maria Pilar Abel, who claims to be the result of a liaison her mother had with Dalí in 1955.Abel has been seeking to prove her parentage for the past 10 years and says the physical resemblance to the surrealist painter is so strong, ?the only thing I?m missing is a moustache?.She says it was an open secret in her family that the artist was her biological father.She told the Spanish newspaper El País that she first learned of her true paternity from the woman she said she had thought was her paternal grandmother. Abel claims she told her: ?I know you aren?t my son?s daughter and that you are the daughter of a great painter, but I love you all the same.? She also noted that her granddaughter was ?odd, just like your father?.Under Spanish law, Abel would be heir to a quarter of Dalí?s fortune if the DNA supports her contention. The Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation, which controls the artist?s lucrative estate, had unsuccessfully sought to fight the exhumation by appealing against a judge?s decision late last month to let it go ahead. As Dalí bequeathed his properties and fortune to the foundation and the Spanish state, Abel has brought her claims against both.In 2007, she was granted permission to try to extract DNA from skin, hair and hair traces found clinging to Dalí?s death mask. However, the results proved inconclusive.Another attempt to find DNA was made later the same year, using material supplied by the artist?s friend and biographer Robert Descharnes. Although Abel has claimed she never received the results of the second test, Descharnes? son Nicholas told the Spanish news agency Efe in 2008 that he had learned from the doctor who conducted the tests that they were negative.Abel told the Spanish news agency Europa Press that she was looking forward ?to the truth being known once and for all?, adding: ?I?m not nervous but happy and positive.?The results of the latest DNA test are expected in a month or two. Once the samples have been tested, they will be returned to Dalí?s grave."

"UAE's envoy to India Ahmed Al Banna has denied media reports claiming that underworld don Dawood Ibrahim's assets worth ?15,000 crore were seized in Dubai. ""A legal process has to be followed in the country for an action against any individual,"" he said. Notably, BJP had also cited the reports claiming the seizure to be PM Narendra Modi's diplomatic masterstroke.","summarize: United Arab Emirates' envoy to India Ahmed Al Banna has denied media reports that wanted underworld don Dawood Ibrahim's properties and assets were raided in UAE.He dismissed the media reports that claimed property worth Rs 15,000 crore had been seized.A couple of weeks ago when reports about raids on Dawood's properties surfaced, even BJP's official social media handles went on an overdrive, claiming it to be a masterstroke of PM Modi's diplomacy.INDIA TODAY EXCLUSIVE: India media has already painted me black, says Dawood IbrahimA series of tweets had credited PM Modi's diplomacy with the success. It said, the prime minister had handed over a list of Dawood's properties during his visit to the UAE in 2015, and demanded the authorities to act against Dawood.Speaking exclusively to India Today, UAE envoy Al Banna said a legal process has to be followed in the country for an action against any individual. EXCERPTS FROM THE INTERVIEW:Q: Coming to area of security cooperation, in recent years we have seen an extradition treaty between India and UAE and some individuals have been deported. In terms of one specific name Dawood Ibrahim, there were reports that NSA Ajit Doval has handed over a dossier to UAE, can you confirm it sir?A: Well, I know there are international laws, rules and regulations, there are bilateral agreements and those agreements you know finalises any or emphasises on any decision that a country might take in terms of extraditing. Now, there is judicial system and there is a legal system and within the international framework within those agreements signed, the judicial and legal system works. Now, I have no information on who specifically they have been looked at or asked for but I know we have a very strong relationship and there has been several meetings between the NSA and our NSA and other organisations in the UAE and within that framework, within the legal framework, within the agreement there will be a final understanding.Q: Because there are also reports that UAE had cracked down and confiscated some of the properties. Again, we don't know whether it is true, untrue. Would you like to confirm?A: This is the first time I hear of it. I don't know anything of that as I mentioned UAE is a country where there are rules, regulations, laws, constitution and if there are any proceedings in our legal system, within our jurisdiction system then let it be. I don't think any action can be taken against anyone without that legal process, without the jurisdiction process.Q: But if you find substance in India's evidences against Dawood Ibrahim, the UAE will act?A: Then again, there are agreements as I said. The agreements between India and UAE will handle that and the meetings that will take place will handle that.WATCH: "
"Newly-appointed Army Chief General Bipin Rawat has said that the Indian forces would cross the border again if peace and tranquility are not maintained after attempting to resolve things through negotiations. ""Wars will be intense and short because there will always be international pressure... Whatever action we take, therefore, has to be quick; forces have to be ready,"" Rawat added.","summarize: 25 Safdarjung Road, the official residence of the vice-chief of army staff, thrums with activity early on a foggy January morning, just days after General Bipin Rawat assumed office on New Year's Day as India's 27th chief of the army staff. (His official 4 Rajaji Marg residence is under renovation.) His twin Dachshunds, Dash and Tickle, shoot around like little guided torpedoes clad in identical red-and- black-trimmed winter fleece. Staff officers and Tavor rifle-wielding bodyguards of the special forces flank the fleet of black armoured Scorpios waiting to make the short two km drive to his office deep within the sandstone corridors of South Block. The general appears in the verandah of his home, proffers a firm handshake. He's of medium height, stockily built, with salt and pepper hair and a neatly trimmed white moustache. He listens carefully, looks you in the eye when he speaks, and the clearly articulated sentences are delivered like a military drum roll. He clearly plays on the front foot. There is simply no question that will induce any hesitation on his part, from tackling China and Pakistan, surgical strikes, the controversial Cold Start war doctrine to the polemic around his selection as army chief, superseding two senior army commanders. As he sat down for an extensive interview with Executive Editor Sandeep Unnithan, General Rawat revealed why he was supremely confident of navigating the minefield that lies ahead in his three-year tenure. Excerpts:What do you see as your main security challenges and how do you plan to handle developments like the reorganisation of China's armed forces?The primary role of the armed forces is the defence of the borders, preparation for conventional warfare, maintaining internal security and focusing on disaster relief. We are studying the restructuring of the PLA to see its efficacy. We will study their reforms and see whether they have relevance in our context. If so, we will put them across with modifications to the government.The army's China-specific Mountain Strike Corps has been languishing for want of funds. Is this relevant in our context?We raised the Mountain Strike Corps (MSC) as part of a transition from dissuasion and deterrence to credible deterrence. All adversaries respect credible strength, which comes from such formations capable of striking across the border. We are expected to remain defensive in order to ensure there are no incursions and the sanctity of the borders is maintained. But you cannot always remain defensive. We must also have the capability to conduct offensive operations. Whether these forces are going to be used physically will depend on the situation, but surely these forces meet the purpose of credible deterrence. So, we'll certainly give impetus to raising the corps. The government has given us permission to induct manpower, infrastructure development along the border is taking place, weapons and equipment are coming in.Did the army's September 29, 2016 surgical strikes define our new red lines in a strong response to a high-casualty attack by terrorists?All nations and armies define their own thresholds. The December 13, 2001 Parliament attack was a threshold. In a terrorist attack, it is the nature of the attack and the success the terrorists are able to achieve-sometimes what happens is that the terrorists get success because of incidental damage caused. Uri, for example, was an incidental success because there were troops in tents, troops who were grouped together. In Nagrota, they did not get so much success, they did not get so many people, we were able to eliminate them before they could do damage. So the threshold level will vary and [determine] the kind of reaction, because our nation is not a warmongering nation. We want peace and tranquility, and if we find that something can be resolved through negotiations, an attempt is always made to resolve it through negotiations but if we find these incidents getting repeated, we define a threshold, a decision is taken, recommendations are made, and we will go across again. It is very difficult to say if there are red lines (in response to terrorist attacks). What I can say is that there are dotted lines, and those dots are then joined together by us to draw a red line.Is the Cold Start doctrine-instituted after Operation Parakram in 2001-still an option in response to attacks like the one on Parliament in 2001 or 26/11 in Mumbai?The Cold Start doctrine exists for conventional military operations. Whether we have to conduct conventional operations for such strikes is a decision well-thought through, involving the government and the Cabinet Committee on Security.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had, in the combined commanders' conference in 2015, said that future conflicts will become shorter, and wars will become rare. Do you have any strategy for short, intense wars?In our case, we prepare for short, intense conflicts, and at the same time have to be prepared for wars becoming long-drawn. Based on that, we have a well-defined strategy. What the PM said is right; wars will be intense and short because there'll always be international pressure in wars between two nations. We have to be aware of that; whatever action we take, therefore, has to be quick; forces have to be ready and have to achieve success.The modernisation of the Indian Army has been an area of major concern for you and your predecessors. Have you identified any key areas for delivery during your tenure?Technology is constantly changing. You cannot be using older technologies for your weapons systems and equipment. My thinking is that you have to look at emerging technology because of the time it takes for a weapons system to be inducted into the armed forces. So you have to look at tomorrow's technology for inducting weapons. With that in mind, we have also focused on certain weapons systems. Infantry is the most affected-deployed along the border round the clock, in internal security situations, and in the face of frequent ceasefire violations on the border-we need to give them modern weapons technology best suited to such an environment. The mechanised forces need future battle tanks and Infantry Combat Vehicles, new aviation assets, air defence systems, artillery and other longer ranged weapon systems that have more lethality and accuracy. We are also looking at upgrading operational logistics systems. The modernisation priorities have been spelt out by my predecessor [Gen. Dalbir Singh] and we are continuing with the same vision and thrust areas because I feel they have been thought through and holistically define the army's requirements.Do you see an emerging threat in the new China-Pakistan proximity and how do you propose to respond to it?National security strategy by any nation is defined by its national interests. China has defined its national interests by coming close to Pakistan in looking for access to the Indian Ocean Region, for energy security, trade. Today, economics defines national strategy and wherever people find economic gain, there are cooperative mechanisms and alliances. We also have to look at our national interests and continue doing whatever is best in our national interests. We will also counter such mechanisms through our own means; our government is quite capable of handling [these]. We are also carrying out actions to negate the nexus developing between China and Pakistan.Would you elaborate on these measures?We are addressing the neighbourhood, the extended neighborhood and the Far West. We are looking at certain countries on China's eastern seaboard, and the Americas. There are groupings that are taking place. While we are proud of being non-aligned, there are times when you have to get into some groupings, which is of course in the domain of foreign policy, so I wouldn't like to really comment. We have masters in foreign policy and they do it really well. Our diplomacy is moving well, the prime minister's focus is on the global arena, we will be able to counter whatever is happening through our foreign policy.What are your expectations from a closer military partnership with the United States?Our expectations are that we must live like friends - the economic partnership will grow stronger and everything else will fall into place. We are sharing expertise but that is more in the field of humanitarian assistance and disaster response. We do try out some joint training as far as counter-insurgency [is concerned]. The US does consider us a lead nation in Counter Insurgency Ops; they have specialisation in special forces operations which we look at. As for equipment, we have a system of global tendering, and I feel we should go for whoever gives us the best. Finally, we should support our domestic industry. What it will depend on is who is willing to come here, share technology and help our domestic industry grow and help us in becoming self-reliant, so we needn't be country-fixated.We have been hearing a lot about the rivalry between the infantry and the armoured corps. Would you set the record straight on this?"

"The Al Ponte café in Amsterdam, Netherlands provides discounts to residents in return for plastic wastes. The initiative is part of a pilot project named 'Wasted', which incentivises households to recycle their plastics. For every bag of plastics, households earn one green coin which can be used for a free second coffee.","summarize: Located just behind Amsterdam Centraal station with views looking out across the river IJ, Al Ponte is a popular cafe serving a constant stream of commuters on their way to and from the nearby ferry port. Not all Al Ponte?s customers pay for their coffees, however. Not in the traditional sense anyway.Al Ponte is one of the businesses participating in Wasted, a pilot project running in Amsterdam?s Noord district which incentivises households to recycle their plastics by rewarding them with discounts at local businesses.When prospective participants sign up they are given bags labelled with unique QR codes, enabling the scheme?s organisers to apportion the correct credit to each household once the filled bags have been collected. For every bag of plastics they produce households earn one green coin. At present the coins are sent to users in the post, although next year Wasted?s organisers want to develop the scheme?s digital currency. As well as reducing bureaucracy, this will enable them to engage online businesses in offering rewardsAt Al Ponte, one coin earns users a free second coffee. Meanwhile, over at BeekhovenBikes Fietsspecialist?s cycle shop three coins earn users 50% off tyre repairs. Discounts on accountancy support, groceries and reiki treatments are also included in the list of rewards offered by the 30 or so participating retailers.Silvia Salani, who owns Al Ponte, says there are days when only one or two customers have a coin to exchange and others when that number reaches double figures. As well as improving her standing in the community, Salani believes being part of the scheme has been positive for business growth as she sees those who first came in with friends for free coffees returning as paid customers.Since Wasted was set up in early 2015 by Dutch non-profit the Cities Foundation, more than 700 households have signed up. In a previous iteration of the project, staff from the Cities Foundation collected the plastics from users? homes and fed them into the municipal recycling scheme. As the project has scaled, however, the city council, which subsidises the project, has taken over the weekly collection.The city council doesn?t normally offer domestic collection of recyclables, instead providing Noord?s 87,000 residents with on-street containers. With Wasted, however, it has said is keen to support the Cities Foundation?s goal to connect waste management with supporting local entrepreneurs.In a recent survey of Wasted users, 52% of respondents said they had improved their waste disposal habits as a result of using Wasted and 23% said they had reduced their total plastics consumption. ?People start to realise how much plastic they produce on a weekly basis and it is pretty distressing,? says Francesca Miazzo, founder of the Cities Foundation.Broader research to date suggests schemes that reward residents to recycle have mixed long-term results. A study carried out by independent consultancy Eunomia, commissioned by Serco, shows such initiatives have ?highly variable? results.?Unfortunately there?s no real indication that reward schemes outperform simply publicising pre-existing recycling scheme information,? says Peter Jones, a principal consultant at Eunomia. While Miazzo acknowledges the long-term challenge, she believes activating community participation and creating awareness can help sustain positive behaviour: ?We want to engage those who don?t usually care about recycling, while building a social contract between the community and business owners that goes beyond the traditional consumer relationship,? she says.

"Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for 'centralising power' and taking away the independence of the states. ""Do we have true democracy in the country if all affairs are going to be run according to the wishes of the Prime Minister?"" Thackeray questioned in an interview to the party's mouthpiece Saamana.","summarize: swapnil.rawal@hindustantimes.comThe Shiv Sena launched yet another scathing attack on its ally the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through its mouthpiece Saamana on Sunday. In an interview to the newspaper, party chief Uddhav Thackeray attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of ?centralising? power.In a chat with Sena Member of Parliament and executive editor of Saamana Sanjay Raut, Thackeray attacked Modi over his style of functioning, demonetisation, Good and Services Tax (GST) and the PM?s poll pitch ?acche din?. ?The ?acche din? are only limited to government advertisement; the ground reality is completely different. Do we have true democracy in the country if all affairs are going to be run according to the wishes of the Prime Minister? He is centralising power, instead of decentralising it. He is taking away the independence of the states,? Thackeray said.Thackeray, who has been a staunch critic of demonetisation, said the move has not yielded anything positive, instead, it has affected the livelihood of people. ?Around 15 lakh people lost their jobs because of demonetisation. This means around 60 lakh people were directly affected. You should give them jobs now. How are you going to balance ?Start-up India?, ?Make in India? programmes with such colossal job losses? ? Thackeray asked.He also slammed the state government over the farm loan waiver. Thackeray said the government should table the list of 36 lakh farmers, who were going to get the benefit of the waiver in the upcoming Monsoon session. He said the party would continue its ?dhol bajao andolan? (protest by beating drums) to turn the heat on the government over implementing the loan waiver.Interestingly, the Sena chief said he shares a cordial relationship with Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. ?There was no personal animosity between me and the current chief minister. My relation with him is really good. Often, he has accepted the suggestions I have given. He is putting forward views of his party, I am representing the people of the state. The difference is only that,? he said.The two parties share an uncomfortable relationship ever since 2014 Assembly polls where they contested independently. Earlier in 2017, the BJP and the Sena parted ways for the Mumbai civic elections. Sena, which is the junior partner in the central and state governments, has never missed an opportunity to speak up against the BJP and the prime minister. Reiterating his stand, Thackeray said he and his party will continue to speak up whenever they disagree with the decision of the BJP in the state and at the Centre. ?I want to explain my stand here. Whenever I say something or Sena speaks, we are considered anti-government. I am not anti-government. I am merely on the side of the people,? he said."

"Actress-filmmaker Pooja Bhatt revealed that her 2003 production 'Jism' earned more money at the box-office as compared to films 'Zakhm', 'Tamanna', 'Dushman' and 'Sur' combined. She said, ""I'm not interested in making movies that only 10 people will watch and will get critical appreciation at some festival."" Pooja added she's a commercial filmmaker and wants people to watch her films.","summarize: During her recent interview with HTBrunch, Pooja Bhatt revealed that after making sensitive movies like Zakhm and Tamanna, she ventured into adult content with Jism because those kind of movies have a mass appeal.?My first production was Tamanna. The age that Alia is today, I had made a film on female infanticide. It won a National Award. But the audience hardly came to watch the film in the theatres. Then I made Zakhm, again a sensitive movie based on my father?s real life story, was a box office disaster. Not a single person went to watch it in the theatres. It is not that it didn?t have star value. It had names like Ajay Devgn, Nagarjuna, Pooja Bhatt and Mahesh Bhatt. But that failed to get the audience to buy the tickets. Then I made Jism. The business of Jism is more than the collective business off Zakhm, Tamanna, Dushman, Sur all put together.?India pretends concerns, but watches something else. It is people who made Jism run to packed houses. Just as if a magazine is not getting readers, you need to tweak it to suite their taste, eventually, with movies it?s about business and people will only put money in something that will yield profit,? she says.And she has taken her lessons from one of the best in the business, her father, Mahesh Bhatt. ?My father always says that there are two kinds of cinema. One that you make to jolt the audience and the other is the kind you make to soothe the jolted. Eighty per cent of India lives below the poverty line and they want escapism. And there is the elite intellectual audience who goes to the cinemas in the fine saris and gold and they want to see the other side - the darker side that has poverty and diseases. So it depends on who you choose to cater to.?Pooja is of the opinion that neither of the two is inferior as each fulfils the need of one set of audience. ?To me, a Dabangg is as relevant as a Masaan. I loved both films, each appealed to a different sensibility in me. I am a commercial filmmaker and I make no bones about that. At the end of the day I want people to watch my films. I am not interested in making movies that only 10 people will watch and will get critical appreciation at some festival.?Also, Jism is a film she stands by. ?It was the first true adult film of our times. For a change, it was about a strong woman talking about her sexual needs . Unlike the sex comedies today, it had no double entendre, no bad jokes, nothing. It was a movie made by adults, for adults. When sex is regarded as a bad word, the society starts to rot from inside. ?The definition of a b***h nowadays is that you know your mind and are unafraid to state it,? says Pooja. ?By that logic, I am certainly a b***h. For I certainly know what I want. More than that, I know what I don?t want. And so did my heroine in Jism.?

"The Public Works Department (PWD) has approved the construction of a flyover costing ?50 crore near Ghaziabad's Raj Nagar Extension. The flyover, proposed by the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA), is aimed at decongesting the city roads. The construction of this 538-metre-long split-type flyover will begin after its modified design report is vetted by IIT Roorkee. ","summarize: The public works department (PWD) has cleared the proposal for the construction of a flyover over the erstwhile NH-58 near Raj Nagar Extension (RNE). After NH-58 was denotified as a highway last year, it was assigned as ?other district road? to the PWD as per a state government notification in June.Due to massive inflow of traffic on the Ghaziabad-Meerut Road (erstwhile NH-58), officials of the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) had proposed the construction of a flyover and also altered the design, by making it a split-type flyover, as the regional rapid transit system (RRTS) corridor passes through the median of the road.?We have given clearance for the project to the GDA. They will have to prepare a service lane in the area and also have to take care of the piped gas line that passes through the area. They will make use of additional land in the vicinity and also remove encroachments. We also reviewed their traffic plan and have given them the permission after a thorough study,? said Manish Verma, executive engineer, PWD.?We also checked the RRTS alignment and had also asked them to take permission from the agency concerned. The clearance was given on a review of the traffic regulation plan and provision for the RRTS alignment. We are also planning to make the road a state highway and will send a proposal to the government. This is because the volume of traffic has remained the same despite the road being denotified as a highway,? he said.The proposed flyover, spanning 538 metres, is pegged at Rs50 crore and its design was changed from combined six-lane to three-lane (each side) split-type one. The middle portion between the two lanes will be used for the RRTS, which will come up on an elevated section, like the metro train system.The authority had proposed the flyover to decongest the city roads as a heavy volume of traffic is witnessed at the intersection.?The design for the flyover has been approved by the RRTS agency. The flyover design report is waiting to be vetted by IIT, Roorkee. The UP state bridge corporation is the construction agency. Once the design is vetted, the flyover construction can be started. We have received clearances from PWD for the project,? said Chakresh Jain, executive engineer, GDA.The authority has also proposed a flyover in Vasundhara, over the Link Road. Officials said that the proposed design is not in conflict with the RRTS alignment and pegged the cost at Rs50 crore."

"Calling Venezuela's recent Constituent Assembly election a ""sham"", US Ambassador Nikki Haley said that Venezuela is heading towards a dictatorship. Haley also threatened strong and swift action against the ""architects of authoritarianism"" in Venezuela. She added that the US stands by Venezuelans and their constitutional representatives to restore their country to a full and prosperous democracy.","summarize: The United States has vowed to take strong and swift action against the ?architects of authoritarianism? in Venezuela after protesters and security forces fought deadly street battles during voting for President Nicolás Maduro?s controversial constitutional assembly.?The United States stands by the people of Venezuela, and their constitutional representatives, in their quest to restore their country to a full and prosperous democracy,? the US State Department said in a statement. ?We will continue to take strong and swift actions against the architects of authoritarianism in Venezuela, including those who participate in the national constituent assembly as a result of today?s flawed election,? it said. Many voters decided against taking part in an election the opposition said would turn the country into a full-fledged dictatorship.As many as 14 people died in the protests, according to opposition leader Henrique Capriles, and the prosecutor?s office confirmed at least six people were killed by gunfire, including one national guardsman. Seven policemen were wounded in an explosion in the opposition stronghold neighbourhood of Altamira.However, the leader of the ruling socialist party, Jorge Rodriguez, said there was ?not one death related to the voting process today?, underscoring the contrasting versions of the day presented by the two clashing sides.Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, tweeted: ?Maduro?s sham election is another step toward dictatorship.?Maduro?s sham election is another step toward dictatorship. We won't accept an illegit govt. The Venezuelan ppl & democracy will prevail.An official report of a ?positive? election process by the National Electoral Council contrasted with continued reports of clashes and widespread abstention as people either heeded opposition calls for a boycott or feared getting caught up in street clashes.The council extended voting for one hour, claiming many who had wanted to casttheir vote earlier had been unable to do so.Maduro was among the first to vote shortly after polls opened at 6am. ?The first vote for peace,? he said afterwards. But throughout the day, turnout at polling stations was low for the election of 545 members of an assembly that would be tasked with rewriting the constitution and would have sweeping powers to reform or dissolve other state institutions, including the opposition controlled parliament.In the working-class district of Petare, where many residents said they had been threatened with losing government subsidies or jobs if they did not vote, few people turned out to vote. But at the Poliedro sporting arena, where Caracas residents who were unable to reach their designated polling centre were permitted to cast their votes, voters described huge crowds standing in line. For Maria Alejandra Avila, a lawyer , the election was a manifestation of ?the self?determination of a free and sovereign people?.The constituent assembly has been heavily criticised by foreign government including from the United States, the UK and neighbouring Colombia. On Sunday, Peru and Argentina said they would not recognise the outcome of the vote.Security forces blocked protesters from gathering for a planned mass demonstration using teargas to disperse the crowd, witnesses said. A small group of protesters blocked access to some of the voting places.?The oppressive forces didn?t allow us to even get to the meeting point,? said protester Emilia López, 23. ?It is frustrating that they try to keep us quiet with bombs.?Opposition leader María Corina Machado told reporters that this moment was the beginning of a new phase for Venezuela.The defence minister, Vladimir Padrino López, told reporters that a 130,000-strong security force was ?actively containing? flareups across the country, adding that as many as 100 voting machines had been destroyed.Security cordons were set up around each voting centre and reporters were not allowed beyond that point to witness people casting their votes. After more than four months of protests sparked by the pro-government supreme court decision to strip the opposition-controlled parliament of its legislative powers, the government banned protests ahead of Sunday?s vote. Maduro has said the assembly will help bring peace to the politically split country, but the opposition, and increasingly the international community, have warned that it will only serve for Maduro and the ruling socialist party to tighten their grip on power. The new assembly will be convened within 72 hours of the election and will function with virtually unlimited powers. Maduro and his closest allies have vowed to use the assembly to jail key opposition leaders, remove the country?s outspoken chief prosecutor from her post and strip opposition legislators of their constitutional immunity.Polls show that Maduro, successor to Hugo Chávez, who set the country on a socialist path, has only about a 20-point approval rating and that 70% of Venezuelans do not want the constitution of 1999 rewritten.Maduro said on Saturday that the assembly would act as a ?superpower (...) above and beyond every other?. The assembly, he said in a television address ahead of the vote, will be empowered to strip opposition legislators of immunity from prosecution. ?The right wing already has its prison cell waiting,? the president said.Maduro accused right-wing governments of trying to sabotage ?21st century socialism?.The US imposed targeted sanctions against 13 current and former officials close to the government last week and has primed further measures if the assembly vote was held, which may affect Venezuela?s oil industry, one of the few economic lifelines left in the country. Under Maduro, elected after Chávez?s death from cancer in 2013, the once buoyant oil-based economy plunged into crisis crippling the social programs Chavez had set up for Venezuela?s poor majority. Price controls brought widespread food and medicine shortages and spiralling inflation, as well as unbridled violence, driving millions of Venezuelans to leave the country.Additional reporting by Ana Sofia Romero in Caracas   "

"The first Indian-origin woman in space, Kalpana Chawla was born on March 17, 1962. Chawla moved to the United States in 1982 and joined NASA in 1988. Describing her first mission in space, she said, ""You are just your intelligence"", on experiencing weightlessness. The astronaut died with six crew members on her second mission aboard the Columbia spacecraft in 2003.","summarize: For two months after she became the first Indian woman to be launched in space, 35-year-old Kalpana Chawla, the Karnal-born scientist, remained incommunicado. That's largely because the National Space and Aeronautical Administration (NASA), the authority that controls space flights in the US, was investigating what went wrong with one of the missions that Chawla and her five other crew members had to undertake during their 15-day space odyssey in November last year. Chawla was assigned the task of releasing Spartan, the $10 million (Rs 40 crore) solar-physics satellite from the space shuttle's bay. Either a systems malfunction or an error of judgement caused it to spin out of control and it took a daring space walk by the crew to retrieve it. NASA investigation showed it was the result of a series of small errors and absolved Chawla, calling her ""a terrific astronaut"". In an exclusive telephone interview from Houston, she spoke to Deputy Editor Raj Chengappa last week. Excerpts:Q. When you were first free from the clutches of gravity after lift-off, can you describe the physical and mental feeling?A. When you lift off the pressure is supposed to be maximum. But actually it was very benign. Very enjoyable. But as soon as the engines cut off and you get to zero gravity, you felt as if you were being pushed off your seat. You feel disoriented. You don't feel aligned with anything. I felt for a few good hours that I was falling. In fact, you are in a free fall- that's what zero gravity is all about. But the first few hours, the workload was so much that it was hard to realise the magic of the experience. But afterwards the feeling was literally out of this world.Q. What is the strangest thing about being in zero gravity?A. One of the strangest things is that when I was about to sleep, I realised I was only aware of my thoughts. Because you are weightless you don't feel your legs or your body. In a sense then, you are just your intelligence. It's amazing you can't feel anything but your consciousness.Q. How did you feel about becoming the first Indian woman to be in space?A. I never truly thought of being the first or second someone. Or being a small-town girl. This is just something I wanted to do. It was very important for me to enjoy it. If you want to do something, what does it matter where you are ranked? Nor does being a woman make a difference. We were all just crew members.Q. Did looking down at the earth from space change your concept of it?A. It did. The first view of the earth is magical. All of us had grown fond of watching the Himalayas pass by. I saw the Brahmaputra and how it turned to meet the Ganges. And the Ganges delta looked very serene. What is mindboggling is the tremendous speed we were going at. We crossed the Himalayas in less than two minutes, and then you realise, ""Oh My God"" within an hour and a half, we have gone around the whole planet. It is a very overpowering realisation that the earth is so small. The atmosphere looks like a ribbon with different colours hugging the earth. That, in addition, lends so much to its fragility. It affected me. I could not get over the notion that in such a small planet, with such a small ribbon of life, so much goes on.Q. Did you think about Karnal or India?A. We passed over India lots of times. And sometimes I would think, oh I have been there. Especially while passing over New Delhi. You couldn't really spot it but I pointed it out to my crew members and said I lived near there. But I really didn't see countries by themselves, I just saw land.Q. Does the earth look all blue from up there?A. The earth is not just a bluish hue. You actually see all the colours. It was spectacular. For example, when the Sahara comes into view, the ocean near it is an emerald green. It is shockingly beautiful. The Sahara itself looks golden brown. Then you cross the Nile, and it looks like a deep, dark green ribbon and immediately you can tell why it is the lifeline of the desert.Q. How did it affect you? A. The nice thing about it is that if there are any blemishes, it is lost. Everything looks pretty. It is as if the whole place is sacred. You get the feeling that I need to work extraordinarily hard along with other human beings to respect that.Q. Do you see the pollution?A. I did see it and it was one of the unfortunate sights. For instance, you can see smokestacks. We saw fires, one over Australia. We also saw smog layers over Taiwan.Q. Did you long for Indian food when you were up in space?A. My crewmates, especially my Japanese colleague who loves curries, would say: ""How can you survive with the stuff we are eating here?"" I would just laugh it off. I didn't miss it much.Q. Did you feel Indian or a sense of Indianness?A. To the contrary. On one of the night passes, I dimmed the lights in the flight deck and saw the stars. When you look at the stars and the galaxy, you feel that you are not just from any particular piece of land but from the solar system. I could extend the whole thing-maybe one day people will go to other galaxies and then what would we say? Where did we come from? I am a resident of the Milky Way?Q. What exactly happened during the Spartan satellite release manoeuvre? What malfunctioned?A. We don't know about the malfunction part. NASA is looking into all these things. It isn't one big thing but a number of small things that made us get to where we were at the end.Q. Were you hurt by some of the reports in the Indian media that blamed you?A. I just haven't had the time to look at the reports. But NASA did not blame me at all. I wasn't hurt because I figured that in the end everyone would know what the truth was.Q. What was your immediate feeling when things went wrong?A. At that time, one is so busy and focused on the task that one doesn't feel anything. My immediate feeling was that we had 13 more days to go, with plenty of experiments that had nothing to do with the satellite. This included a space walk. And we had to focus on our mission and make the best of it.Q. When you returned, what was the first thing you wanted to do?A. I wanted to go on a canoeing trip and feel the wind in my face. That's one thing you miss when you're out there. I missed the fresh air."

It will be solved, in every detail, and it will be punished, as severely as our laws demand. For now, there is little we know of this deed with certainty. ?But given the current information we have, we have to assume we are dealing with a terrorist attack. I know that it would be particularly hard to bear for all of us if it was confirmed that a person committed this crime who asked for protection and asylum in Germany. This would be particularly repugnant in the face of the many many Germans who have dedicated themselves day after day to helping refugees, and in the face of the many people who actually need our protection and try to integrate into our country.?I?m in constant contact with the minister of interior, De Maizière, with the president, and with the mayor of Berlin, Michael Müller. The security cabinet will convene in a few hours. ?Together with the mayor and the minister of the interior I will go to the Breitscheidplatz in the afternoon in order to pay our respects.

"The members of the Bharatiya Bar Girls Union in Maharashtra on Monday said to the Supreme Court that the prevailing ban-like atmosphere in the state could push bar dancers into activities like prostitution. The union further reminded the court that the closing down of the bars in 2005 had left over 75,000 female workers unemployed.","summarize: Maharashtra's bar dancers have waltzed up to the Supreme Court and argued that the prevailing ban-like atmosphere in the state could push them into activities like prostitution.Members of the Bharatiya Bar Girls Union knocked on the SC's door on Monday against the ""unjust and arbitrary"" new restrictions such as curbs on body movement, ban on acceptance of tips and showering of money as well as serving of liquor in performing area apart from mandatory installation of CCTV cameras.They reminded the court that the closing down of the bars in 2005 left over 75,000 female workers unemployed. They brought to the apex court's attention the observation of another bench that struck down a similar state law. The plea will be heard on March 2. The Maharashtra government had over a decade ago suspended the licences of bars and hotels where young women were employed to dance to racy film songs for male customers, claiming they were a bad influence on society.But the top court said last year that bars could once again apply for licences.SUPREME COURT'S JUDGMENTThe SC had in an earlier judgment said, ""It has been brought on the record that many of them (bar dancers) have been compelled to take up prostitution out of necessity for maintenance of their families. In our opinion, the impugned legislation has proved to be totally counterproductive and cannot be sustained.""This is the first time that bar dancers themselves have come forward to oppose the Maharashtra law.Till now the challenge was only from hotel, restaurant and dance bar owners. The fresh plea has termed the new Act as ""arbitrary"" and ""violative"" of their right to earn a livelihood through legitimate means. The union alleges that the term ""obscene dance"" in the Act has been deliberately kept vague to allow police to harass performers.The SC had earlier slammed the Maharashtra Police on the matter. The apex court summoned and reminded the Mumbai DCP (licensing) that it was better for women to perform in dance bars than indulge in ""unacceptable activities"".""You have to change your mindset,"" Justice Dipak Misra had said. ""Regulation is different from prohibition.""ALSO READ: India Today impact: Thane municipality razes 27 illegal dance bars to the ground"

All the research material has already been submitted to the FDA several times for the past 5 years. Our state is bound to become a laughing stock if the ban isn?t continued,? he added.Incidentally, Maharashtra was the first state to ban gutka in July 2013. A year later, a ban on pan masala was brought in force.Dr Pallavi Garade, food safety commissioner, FDA, could not be reached despite numerous attempts, however an FDA official who did not wish to be named told HT that the decision to reconsider the ban on the sale of scented areca nut was taken as there was growing pressure from lobbyists. ?There were several appeals made to the CM (chief minister), regarding the ban on areca nut,? he added. Dr Kailash Sharma, director (Academics) Tata Memorial Hospital said in a letter to the state, ?We sincerely urge you to continue the ban on flavoured chewing tobacco and flavoured supari (Pan Masal) permanently to save our future generations. Currently, the ban is applicable for only one year and it has to be renewed annually."

""Considering the special benefits that are available to Jio Prime members, customers who were unable to subscribe to Jio Prime for any reason, can continue to do so by paying Rs 408 or Rs 608 (Jio Prime + recharge price) to avail these benefits,"" the statement added. Objecting to the offer, incumbent Bharti Airtel hoped that the ""authority (TRAI) will act against this provocative disregard of their direction"". ""... We are surprised to see what Jio is doing. It violates the spirit of the TRAI directive and essentially continues with a similar plan now masquerading under a different name. This is a classic example of old wine in a new bottle,"" an Airtel spokesperson said. Stating that the industry is in a ""very weak"" position and ""continues to bleed"", Airtel said that the financial impact that telcos are seeing does no good to customers, in the long term. ""With a weakened financial position, companies will find it difficult to raise the capital to invest and roll out broadband networks,"" Airtel cautioned. The move by Jio comes within a week of the telecom regulator asking the Mukesh Ambani telecom company to withdraw its contentious three-month complimentary offer of unlimited data usage and free calls on payment of a minimum Rs 303.  TRAI, on April 6, had asked Jio to stop the complimentary service offer saying it was not in accordance with the regulatory framework. TRAI had said that Jio will be required to roll back the 3-month complimentary offer in ""shortest possible time"" but clarified that customers who had already subscribed to the said scheme could avail the benefits till June-end. Earlier this week, telecom operator Vodafone approached TRAI alleging that Jio was inviting last minute subscriptions to its Summer Surprise offer despite the regulator finding it in violation of norms.

Mukunda jointly filed the writ petition before the Tribunal against the BDA from executing the project as it would have caused environmental damage to the garden city.The Tribunal bench, headed by Justice M Chokalingam and expert member PS Rao, passed an interim order, restraining the state government from going ahead with the project till the petitioners' concerns were heard and addressed.""Neither the state government nor BDA considered alternative routes, no study was done to confirm if the steel bridge was the best option, no permission was taken to cut 800 trees and no public hearings were conducted before awarding the project to a private firm,"" claimed the petitioners then."
"Mumbai have included 17-year-old cricketer Prithvi Shaw in their squad for the Ranji Trophy semifinal to be played in Rajkot from January 1. Shaw created a record by scoring 546 runs in the Harris Shield school tournament in 2013, the then-highest score in school cricket and then third-highest score going by all registered scorecards available worldwide in competitive cricket.","summarize: Not all of them may have had their first razor experience but they are ready to smell the perfume ball. Prithvi Shaw's initiation into the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team, aged 17 completes the trio of Mumbai cricket's boy wonders' transition to higher grade cricket. That each one of them have been chosen for Ranji Trophy before reaching adulthood is reassuring that the record makers haven't just been flash in the pan.Prithvi who has made the squad for a game none less than a Ranji Trophy semi-final to be played against Tamil Nadu on January 1 is fresh from a victorious Asia Cup U-19 campaign under Rahul Dravid's tutelage. Prithvi who first made news, aged 14, scoring a record individual score of 546 in the famed Harris Shield, made 191 runs from five matches as an opener in Asia Cup for India U-19. Mumbai's Chairman of selectors Milind Rege while wishing the youngster well did admit Shaw benefitted from lack of quality opening options knocking at the selectors' door. ""Prithvi has scored runs in age group cricket. So we want to try him out. But honestly it's also true that we have struggled to find two good openers for the past two years. With Akhil Herwadkar unavailable, we wanted to reward Prithvi for the runs he has scored,"" Rege told India Today.Rege did add that having had a word with Dravid convinced the selectors to pick Prithvi. ""He did think highly of his batting abilities when I spoke to him,"" he said.  The Mumbai selectors would hope Prithvi's transition from cricketing adolescence to adulthood is more fruitful than another boy wonder, Armaan Jaffer, they tried earlier in the season. Armaan whose schools' record of 498 runs was bettered by Prithvi, could only muster 44 runs in the six innings he played for Mumbai.Rege agrees bridging the gap between age group cricket to Ranji Trophy does not come easy. ""I was surprised Armaan did not do well. He is a very organized player. But making the grade from age group cricket to Ranji Trophy is as difficult as is the one from first class to international cricket,"" he says."

"Days after the Centre banned the sale of cattle for slaughter in the animal markets across the country, cows are being sold online on e-marketplaces such as OLX. ""It's too dangerous keeping cows anymore. Anyone can come and beat us,"" said a cattle owner adding that he was open to a distress sale for 50% less than the market price.","summarize: Hamstrung by the government's restrictions on sale of cattle, farmers and livestock traders have found greener pastures in digital India. So, a swift search on online marketplaces such as OLX shows that hundreds of cows are up for sale in the virtual world.The environment ministry decreed last week that animal markets could only trade cattle for agricultural purposes, such as ploughing and dairy production. The rule came as part of a tough new law against animal cruelty, but critics say they are aimed at placating hardline Hindu supporters of the Narendra Modi government. The Madurai bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday suspended the order for four weeks.Ravi Sharma from Uttar Pradesh's holy city Varanasi, which Prime Minister Modi represents in Parliament, seemed a little wary when spoken to about his online post selling a desi brown cow for Rs 75,000. He first wanted to know what this correspondent intended to do with it and what community she belonged to, categorically stating that he has no interest in selling to a certain minority group.Not far away from Varanasi, in Ghazipur, Bheem Singh is keen to get rid of three cows at the earliest. So much so that he is open to a distress sale for as much as 50 per cent less than the market price for cows. ""It's too dangerous keeping cows any more. Anyone can come and beat us,"" he said while pushing this correspondent to close the deal over the phone.The past two years have seen a rise in vigilante attacks on Muslims and lower caste Hindus involved in the cattle trade, leading to several deaths. A group of alleged ""cow protectors"" thrashed two meat traders on the suspicion that they were carrying beef on May 26. Police in Rajasthan's Bhilwara arrested five people, including an alleged member of the RSS - the BJP's ideological mentor - who torched a truck last week that they thought was carrying cows for slaughter.Several state governments have appealed to the PM to repeal the order, which they say was issued without consultations with them. Some have decided to drag the Centre to court. Environment minister Harsh Vardhan had said that cattle bought and sold directly from farms would not be affected by the government's order. ""The aim of the rules is only to regulate the animal market and sale of cattle in them and ensure (the) welfare of cattle"" in the markets,"" he had said. But many commentators see the move as a blow to beef and leather exports that will leave hundreds of thousands jobless and deprive millions of Christians, Muslims and poor Hindus of a cheap source of protein.It's not that cows have not been sold on e-commerce websites before. They have been available occasionally under the pets section. But there has been a sudden surge since the BJP swept to power in Uttar Pradesh in March with priest-turned politician Yogi Adityanath taking the chief minister's post, and the rise of the gau rakshaks, or cow vigilantes."

From now onwards, Aurobindo Marg is under the jurisdiction of NDMC,"" he iterated.The Safdarjung Hospital director too pointed out that a rapid rise in the number of illegal vendors has created a bottleneck outside the hospital.""It is advisable to shift the bus stop on Ring Road side and shops in the subway of the Ring Road and Aurobindo Marg.

"Confectionery multinational Nestlé has lost its bid against Cadbury to register the shape of the four-finger KitKat chocolate as a trademark, marking its fourth unsuccessful attempt to do so. The court ruled the four-finger design had ""no inherent distinctiveness"" and the shape was not a ""badge or origin"". This will let competitors produce their own KitKat copies without legal consequences.","summarize: It?s enough to make anyone need a sit-down with a cup of tea and a four-fingered chocolate wafer biscuit. The confectionery multinational Nestlé has lost the latest round of its long-running battle with rivals Cadbury to trademark the shape of the KitKat bar in the UK. The court of appeal ruled that the four-finger design had ?no inherent distinctiveness?.After deliberating for months, the three appeals judges delivered their judgment on Wednesday in a 16,000-word ruling that found the KitKat shape was not a ?badge of origin?.?We are concerned here with ... the three-dimensional shape of a chocolate product, that has no inherent distinctiveness,? said Lord Justice Kitchin.The ruling marks the latest stage in a bitter-tasting battle between Nestlé and Mondel?z, the US owner of Cadbury, that have been battling over the KitKat trademark for seven years.Nestle?s appeal followed a UK high court ruling in January last year that blocked the trademark attempt. The European court of justice had previously found that the four-fingered shape, breaking apart with a snap, was not distinctive enough to merit a trademark and that such a designation would not comply with European law.The ruling clears the way for competitors, including the major supermarkets as well as other confectioners, to produce their own copycat KitKats without fear of legal consequences.But a Nestlé spokesperson indicated the Swiss firm was not necessarily prepared to give up, saying it was considering its next move. The company could potentially try to take the case to the UK supreme court.?Nestlé is disappointed by the court of appeal judgment and is considering its next steps,? said the spokesperson. ?KitKat is much loved around the world and its four-finger shape is well known by consumers. Nestlé?s four-finger shape has been granted trademark registration in many countries of the world, for instance Germany, France, Australia, South Africa and Canada, further protecting it from imitations.?Following the appeal ruling, a Mondel?z spokesperson said: ?As we have previously stated, we do not believe the shape of the KitKat bar should be protected as a trademark in the UK.?The case turned on whether a the product?s shapewas sufficiently distinctive to the brand to prevent any other manufacturer using a similar format. Protected ?shape marks? are not without precedent ? Toblerone, which is owned by Mondel?z, has successfully trademarked its ?zigzag prism? shape.But the appeal judges found that while the four-finger shape might be ?very well known? in association with KitKat, ?that does not necessarily mean that the public have come to perceive the shape as a badge of origin such that they would rely upon it alone to identify the product as coming from a particular source.?They might simply regard the shape as a characteristic of products of that kind or they might find it brings to mind the product and brand name with which they have become familiar.?These kinds of recognition and association do not amount to distinctiveness for trademark purposes.?The judges also noted that the chocolate bar?s shape had not been central to its marketing in recent years: ?It has nothing, therefore, to do with the informed choices that consumers make between similar products.?The judges heard that Nestlé had spent between £3m and £11m a year advertising and promoting KitKats between 1996 and 2007. More than 40m were sold in Britain in 2010.?The appeal court?s ruling indicates that shape marks are going to be increasingly difficult to obtain,? said Guy Wilmot, partner who specialises in intellectual property law at Russell-Cooke.?The court were ... concerned that if they granted the trade mark, Nestlé would have a potentially permanent monopoly on the four-finger shape, which they felt would be unfair given that KitKat had never used the shape alone to promote KitKats.?Clare Jackman, an intellectual property lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright, said the fact the two multinationals were prepared to battle through the courts for so long showed the value of what was at stake. ?Trademarks are very important and valuable business assets. They confer monopoly rights, so I can see entirely why Nestlé thought, ?our four-finger bar KitKat has been around for ages, let?s register it, because we can stop anyone from producing a bar in four fingers??, she said.?It is typically brand owners in this space that will spend the money and push the boundaries, in trying to get as much protection as possible, because at the end of the day trademarks can potentially last forever, so it really is a signficant monopoly right.?Asked if she could foresee a challenge in supreme court, Jackman said: ?I?m not going to rule it out, because I think these are two brand owners who are prepared to push this as far as it can go.?The four-fingered battle is not the only protracted legal disputes between the two confectioners. In 2004, Cadbury attempted to trademark the shade of purple it uses for its Dairy Milk bars, registering Pantone 2685C in a move that was initially successful before the court of appeal backed Nestlé challenge in 2013. An attempt last year by Cadbury to resurrect an earlier trademark on the colour was rejected by the high court.The first KitKat-type bar was sold in Britain by Rowntree in 1935, when it was called Chocolate Crisp, and the shape has changed little since then. Nestlé acquired Rowntree in 1998.A lookalike called Kvikk Lunsj, translated as ?quick lunch?, launched in Norway in 1937 and is available in some UK shops.? This article was amended on 18 May 2017. The judge?s ruling was not a ?badge of origin?, a previous version said the judge?s ruling was not a ?badge or origin?."

"The farmers in Khardi village in Thane will get a compensation of ?2.43 crore per acre from the Maharashtra government, for their land acquired for the Mumbai-Nagpur super communication highway project. The compensation for non-agriculture land is higher, in some cases as high as ?12.60 crore to ?18.11 crore for an acre of such land in Khardi and Kasara villages.","summarize:  In a move to stem farmers? protests against land acquisition for the ambitious Mumbai-Nagpur super communication highway, the state government seems to have opened its purse strings. This week, the Thane district collectorate finalised land rates for farm land in Shahapur taluka, which is the highest compensation paid to farmers in Maharashtra for a  public project,so far. Farmers from Khardi village in Shahapur taluka stand to get Rs 2.43 crore for an acre of land under this project.  The ready reckoner rate for this village for every hectare of land is around Rs29.59 lakh ( Around 2.4 acres make one hectare of land).The compensation for the 23 villages in this taluka, which will lose land to the 706-km highway, ranges from Rs52.16 lakh to Rs5.84 crore for an hectare for land. This works out to Rs21.66 lakh to Rs2.43 crore for an acre of land.  A copy of the land rates announced for every village per hectare is with HT. After Khardi, farmers from villages like Dalkhan, Birwadi and Kasara will get a generous compensation of around Rs74.84 lakh and Rs68.93 lakh for an acre of land. This is a one-time compensation that will be paid to farmers if they opt for direct settlement with the state government. Read:?Congress and Shiv Sena up the ante against Maharashtra government for blanket loan waiverGiven the wide range, however, not all farmers will be happy with the rates announced. So far, the compensation given to farmers for the Shendre-Bidkin industrial park near Aurangabad under the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor for nearly Rs23 lakh an acre was being considered as one of highest payouts for farm land. (In the case of DMIC, however, separate compensation was also given for orchards).Thane district collector Dr Mahendra Kalyankar confirmed the final land rates for farm land in Shahapur taluka.?We are trying to offer the highest land rate possible for every district affected by the project. It?s history in making,?? said chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.The compensation for non-agriculture land in Shahapur taluka is even higher, in some cases as high as Rs12.60 crore to Rs18.11 crore for an acre of such land in Khardi and Kasara villages. However, only 10 to 15% of non-agricultural land comes under the highway, with officials claiming these rates could get revised as they seemed exorbitant. The proposed eight-lane highway, which will run across 10 districts to link Nagpur to Thane, is facing stiff opposition from farmers over land acquisition. In a bid to tone down these protests, the government is offering competitive land rates to woo the farmers. The land rates are being worked out by committees appointed for every district led by the collector that considers a variety of parameters including ready reckoner rate of every village, average of last three years of sale deeds, the number of land transactions, compensation as per Land Acquisition law etc, 25 per cent more incentive offered by the state for direct sale.Read: Maharashtra farmer complains against IMD for ?wrong? rain forecastLast week, Nasik district collector had announced land rates for the district in the range of Rs40 lakh to Rs80 lakh for one hectare of land. But this had only intensified protests against the project with farmers from Nasik, not wooed by the compensation offered for their irrigated lands.?We have considered a variety of factors and the rates get jacked up also by the number of land transactions that have taken place in that village. In Khardi, for instance, in the recent past, we noted nearly 500 land sale deeds. This was comparatively far less in Chande village that has among the lowest compensations in Shahapur,?? said a Thane district collectorate official.The Thane collectorate has also worked out rates for Kalyan taluka, which are far lower than Shahapur, with the highest compensation being Rs1.50 crore for an hectare of land or Rs62 lakh for an acre of land. The lowest compensation here is around Rs61.14 lakh for an hectare of land or Rs25.47 lakh for an acre of land.The district administration may revise the land rates for Kalyan taluka given that farmers are likely to react negatively given the high rates offered  in neighbouring Shahapur taluka."

"A woman has sued Airbnb for negligence for allowing her to rent a Los Angeles room from a host previously accused of domestic violence. Leslie Lapayowker alleged Carlos Del Olmo, listed as a ""superhost"" for positive reviews, sexually assaulted her. Airbnb said it had conducted a background check but allowed Del Olmo to be a host because he wasn't convicted. ","summarize: An Airbnb guest is seeking to hold the company accountable for an alleged sexual assault, claiming in a first-of-its-kind lawsuit that she was attacked by a host who was not properly screened.The suit, filed Thursday by Leslie Lapayowker, raises fresh questions about the tech firm?s legal responsibilities when hosts violate laws or engage in criminal conduct.Lapayowker is accusing Airbnb of negligence when it allowed her to rent a room from Carlos Del Olmo, who was previously accused of domestic violence. ?I don?t want this to happen to other women,? Lapayowker, a 51-year-old New Mexico woman, told the Guardian. ?It was horrible, and I think that everybody should be warned that this could potentially happen to them or their daughter or their wife or their sister.? Reached by phone, Del Olmo said he was not aware of the complaint and vehemently denied the sexual assault allegation, noting that criminal charges were never filed. An Airbnb spokesperson said that it had conducted a background check on Del Olmo, but because he was not convicted in a previous case, he was allowed to be a host. The company also said it removed him from the site after learning of Lapayowker?s claims.Lapayowker moved to Los Angeles in July of 2016 for a new job as a mortgage broker and had planned to live in Del Olmo?s Airbnb for a month while looking for permanent housing. Del Olmo, who was renting a studio attached to his house, was a ?verified? user and considered a ?superhost? for Airbnb, meaning he had positive reviews and frequently had guests.?I assumed that I would be in especially good hands,? said Lapayowker.But, according to the suit, Del Olmo immediately made her uncomfortable by making sexually suggestive comments, pounding on her windshield while she was in her car and screaming at his son loud enough so she could hear.?He scared me,? she added.Lapayowker decided to leave after three nights, and when she returned to get a laptop she left and told him she was moving out early, Del Olmo said he ?wanted to show her something of importance inside the studio?, the suit said.He then allegedly locked the door, dropped his shorts and began masturbating in front of her, demanding that she touch him and ?taste it?. He ignored her pleas to stop, shoved his tongue into her mouth and eventually ejaculated into a trashcan, according to the lawsuit.He then let her leave the room, saying, ?Don?t forget to leave me a positive review on Airbnb?, the complaint said.?I was completely in shock. I was totally numb,? Lapayowker recalled, saying she initially hesitated calling police. ?I was terrified he would find out where I live and come after me.?Later that month, she reported the incident to police and to Airbnb, which banned Del Olmo from the site. Authorities ultimately declined to file charges, because officials said there was not enough evidence, according to Lapayowker?s attorney. Prosecutors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.But an attorney for Lapayowker discovered that Del Olmo had an earlier arrest in Florida for a battery charge and domestic violence case. A police report said that, according to the victim?s account, he had pulled her hair and dragged her during an argument. He entered a diversion program, which is an alternative to prosecution, the records showed.Lapayowker, who had previously been an Airbnb ?superhost? herself, said she was in disbelief when she learned of the past case: ?I was just furious. Why would they let somebody like this be a host??An Airbnb spokesperson said it runs background checks on all US hosts and guests, looking for matches with terrorist watch lists, felony convictions, sex offender registries and ?significant misdemeanors?.?The abhorrent behavior described has no place in our community and we will not tolerate it. We have been trying to support her in any way we can and we will continue to do so,? the company said in a statement to the Guardian.Del Olmo claimed the encounter with Lapayowker was ?consensual?. He said: ?This woman just fully lied and made everything up.? He said that the woman in the Florida case also lied and noted that he was not convicted.He also argued that it was unfair for Airbnb to kick him off the platform: ?Airbnb has no respect for the homeowner ? who is the one putting themselves in a liability situation.?Teresa Li, Lapayowker?s attorney, argued that Airbnb misleads users with branding that emphasizes the safety of the platform and calling it a ?trusted community marketplace?.?They lure you in and give you this false sense of security,? she said.Airbnb has previously argued that it is not legally responsible when its hosts racially discriminate or violate local housing laws.Lapayowker, who said she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, said she felt Airbnb didn?t take her case seriously: ?I feel like they don?t care. Their entire model is to just get as much business as possible.? "

Whatsapp messages? like ?Wear an Indian Rakhi if you care about your country? have started being circulated in the city.Raksha Bandhan is among the six major festivals that the Sangh celebrates and the campaign comes amid an increasingly bitter New Delhi-Beijing standoff over Doklam, which is under China?s control but claimed by Bhutan. This, Sangh leaders say, has prompted them to think of ways to weaken the Chinese financially.?This time we are going to encourage both traders and buyers not to sell Chinese Rakhi?we want to make the people aware of the sinister designs of the dragon and how by cooperating with us they can help deflate the Chinese ambitions,? said RSS pracharak Mahirajdhwaj Singh, who is associated with the MRM. The RSS has previously campaigned against Chinese crackers during Diwali and its chief, Mohan Bhagwat, called for a boycott of Chinese goods earlier this year.The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), an RSS affiliate floated to promote Indian products, will follow up the initiative with a two-day meeting in Gonda from July 29. Part of the campaign includes door-to-door contacts, making people aware of how the Chinese are allying with Pakistan to create disturbances in India. Sangh volunteers at the Gonda meeting will discuss ways to create awareness among people to boycott Chinese products. Bhola Nath, who is associated with the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, told HT that a massive rally would be organised in Delhi?s Ramlila grounds in October. During the rally, the Modi government will be urged to opt out of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). ?China is cunningly using the WTO to flood the Indian market with cheap goods. There are larger concerns too.

"Employers may bar staff from wearing visible religious symbols, including women wearing Islamic headscarves at work, European Court of Justice ruled on Tuesday. However, customers cannot demand that workers remove headscarves if the company has no policy barring religious symbols, it stated. Notably, this is the EU court's first decision on the issue of women wearing Islamic headscarves at work.","summarize: Politicians on the right have welcomed a ruling by the EU?s highest court that allows companies to ban staff from wearing visible religious symbols, as a long-awaited legal judgment ricocheted into the French and Dutch election campaigns.In its first decision on the issue of women wearing Islamic headscarves at work, the European court of justice in Luxembourg ruled the garments could be banned, but only as part of a general policy barring all religious and political symbols.Nor can customers simply demand workers remove headscarves if the company has no policy barring religious symbols, the court ruled on Tuesday.The long-awaited ruling came on the eve of Dutch elections, where Muslim immigration has been a contentious issue. In France, where the race to succeed President François Hollande remains wide open, politicians on the right seized on the issue.François Fillon, the presidential candidate who has taken a hardline stance on Islam?s place in France, welcomed the judgment. On the day he was placed under formal investigation for misuse of public funds he said in a statement that it was ?an immense relief, not just for thousands of companies but also for their workers?. He said the ruling would be ?a factor in cohesion and social peace?, particularly in France.Gilbert Collard, an MP for the Rassemblement Bleu Marine, which supports Marine Le Pen?s Front National, claimed the ruling was an endorsement. ?Even the ECJ votes Marine,? he wrote on Twitter.In Germany, the rightwing populist party, Alternative für Deutschland, also welcomed the ruling: ?The ECJ?s ruling sends out the right signal, especially for Germany,? said the AfD?s Berlin leader, Georg Pazderski. ?Of course companies have to be allowed to ban the wearing of headscarves.?The ECJ issued a joint judgment in the cases of two women, from France and Belgium, who were dismissed for refusing to remove headscarves.?An internal rule of an undertaking which prohibits the visible wearing of any political, philosophical or religious sign does not constitute direct discrimination,? the court said.It ruled that a company?s wish to project a neutral image was legitimate and allowed internal rules banning political, philosophical or religious symbols.The first case was referred to the ECJ by the Belgian courts. Samira Achbita had been a receptionist for the Belgian branch of G4S, the London-listed outsourcing and security company when, after three years at the firm she decided she wanted to start wearing a headscarf at work for religious reasons. Achbita was fired in June 2006 for refusing to take off her scarf. The company said she had broken unwritten rules prohibiting religious symbols.In the second case, Asma Bougnaoui, a design engineer, was fired from an IT consultancy firm, Micropole, after a customer complained that his staff had been ?embarrassed? by her headscarf while she was on their premises to give advice. She had been told before taking the job that wearing a headscarf might pose problems for the company?s customers.In Achbita?s case the ECJ followed the advice of a senior legal adviser to the court, who argued that companies should be allowed to have policies banning the wearing of religious and political symbols.?The court of justice finds that G4S?s internal rule refers to the wearing of visible signs of political, philosophical or religious beliefs and therefore covers any manifestation of such beliefs without distinction. The rule thus treats all employees to the undertaking in the same way, notably by requiring them, generally and without any differentiation, to dress neutrally.?In Bougnaoui?s case the court?s adviser had ruled that she had suffered discrimination. She had been ?professionally competent? and sacked only because she had refused to remove her headscarf, the advocate general advised.The court upheld this view with a less ringing endorsement. It said customers? wishes not to be served by a worker wearing a headscarf did not give companies a get-out clause from EU anti-discrimination law. ?However, in the absence of such a rule, the willingness of an employer to take account of the wishes of a customer no longer to have the employer?s services provided by a worker wearing an Islamic headscarf cannot be considered an occupational requirement that could rule out discrimination.?The ECJ did not rule on whether Bougnaoui?s dismissal was based on her failure to observe company policies, saying this was a matter for the French court to determine.The German broadsheet Süddeutsche Zeitung predicted that the ruling would fundamentally change how German courts assess similar cases, because the assumption since 2002 had been that religious symbols could not be banned from the workplace on anything other than safety grounds. The ruling, which is more nuanced than a straightforward ban, could sow confusion about which religious symbols can be worn at work. Some legal experts said it seemed to cut against a ruling from the European court of human rights (ECHR) that allowed crosses to be worn.Steve Peers, a professor of EU law at Essex University, said the latest ECJ ruling looked awkward when set against the ECHR judgment that wearing religious symbols is ?sometimes an employee?s right to manifest freedom of religion?. He said the ECJ had not referred to this case law or attempted to deal with the distinction between freedom of religion and non-discrimination.The ECHR is the high court of the 47-member Council of Europe and not part of the EU. Traditionally, the EU court in Luxembourg confined itself to evening out distortions in Europe?s single market, but its remit has grown as EU law has expanded.The ruling prompted dismay from some religious groups. The Conference of European Rabbis, which comprises 700 Jewish leaders across Europe, said Europe was sending a clear message that its faith communities were no longer welcome. Referring to the rise of racially motivated incidents, Pinchas Goldschmidt, the group?s president, called on politicians to ensure Europe did not isolate religious minorities.Maryam H?madoun at the Open Society Justice Initiative said she was disappointed by the ruling, which she described as discrimination against people who chose to show their religion in their dress. ?It will lead to Muslim women being discriminated in the workplace, but also Jewish men who wear kippas, Sikh men who wear turbans, people who wear crosses. It affects all of them, but disproportionately Muslim women,? she said.Stephen Evans, the campaigns director at the National Secular Society in the UK, said: ?Where a ban on employees wearing religious or political symbols is founded on a general company rule of religious and political neutrality, and where that rule is applied equally to all, it can?t be realistically argued that that this constitutes ?less favourable treatment?.?Religious and political neutrality is a perfectly reasonable aim and, where businesses and organisations wish to present themselves in such a way, this ruling demonstrates that this approach is perfectly consistent with equality and human rights law.?Angelique Chrisafis contributed to this report"
"Hitachi Payment Services on Thursday confirmed its systems were hit by malware in 2016, that let hackers steal information from 32 lakh debit cards in India. A loss of ?1.3 crore was suffered by over 600 customers in one of India's biggest cyber security breaches. The compromise period has been identified between May 21 and July 11, 2016.","summarize: Mumbai, Feb 9 (PTI) Hitachi Payments Services today accepted its systems were compromised by a sophisticated malware in mid-2016, that led to one of the biggest cyber security breaches in country with 3.2 million cards affected and a scare over security of card-based transactions. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) had said over 600 customers had reported losses of at least Rs 1.3 crore due to the breach. The company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Japanese Hitachi, made the acknowledgement following the receipt of final assessment report from payments and information security audit firm SISA Information Security, and said it ""regrets"" the inconvenience caused. In what poses more scope for worries, the company said the amount of data exfiltrated is ""unascertainable due to secure deletion by the malware"". ""We confirm that our security systems had a breach during mid-2016,"" its Managing Director Loney Anthony said, adding this happened despite following adequate security measures and adopting the standards of internationally- accepted best practices. The compromise period has been identified between May 21 and July 11. It had come out in public after a slew of banks, including those not serviced by Hitachi, approached customers making either card replacements or ATM PIN changes compulsory. Out then, the compromise was suspected to have happened through one of the ATMs of Yes Bank, one of the biggest clients of the company. Yes Banks Rana Kapoor had called for stricter vigil on the outsourced service providers following the compromise. ""There needs to be a lot more vigilance where there are outsourcing partners to make sure they dont endanger the delivery and system risk, and theres a fair amount of policing as far as outsourcing risks are concerned,"" he said. ""Hitachi Payment Services regrets the inconvenience caused to banks and its customers due to this lapse in its security infrastructure. We assure you of our highest commitment to building a robust infrastructure in our systems and preventing such cyber frauds in future,"" Anthony said. "
"While hearing petitions challenging Aadhaar, the Supreme Court on Tuesday appointed a 9-judge bench to decide whether privacy is a fundamental right or not under the Constitution. While the government has been pushing for Aadhaar citing that it would ensure subsidy schemes reach the targeted, activists claim that it is vulnerable to data breaches and helps government spy on people.","summarize: Is the right to privacy a fundamental right?The question, which forms the basis of petitions that challenge Aadhaar for violating privacy, will be answered by a nine-judge constitution bench.The Supreme Court in Tuesday said the constitution bench would revisit its rulings that said the right to privacy was not a fundamental right and then hear petitions against the 12-digit biometric identity number.?During the course of hearing today it has become essential for us to determine whether right to privacy is a fundamental right under the Constitution,? a five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India JS Khehar said.The nine-judge bench is expected to take up and conclude its hearing on Wednesday itself.?The determination of this question would essentially entail whether the decision recorded by an eight-judge bench in 1954 and also by a six-judge bench in 1962 that there is no such fundamental right is the correct expression of constitutional provisions,? the court said.The court decided to refer the matter to a larger bench after the Centre cited the two judgments to argue that the right to privacy was not a fundamental right.?Our founding fathers have encompassed all rights. But consciously this is omitted,? attorney general KK Venugopal said. But justice J Chelameswar said it was illogical to argue that the Constitution didn?t mention the right to privacy while common law identified it.?Textually it is correct today that there is no right to privacy in the Constitution. But even freedom of press is not expressly stated. This court has interpreted it,? the judge said, adding the earlier verdicts should be looked at again.?One can?t overlook the constant view held by smaller benches in their later judgments holding right to privacy is a fundamental right.?The government is pushing for Aadhaar, saying it is necessary to plug leakages in subsidy schemes and to ensure benefits reach those targeted. But critics say the move violates privacy, is vulnerable to data breaches and helps government spy on people."

Answering the question, the iconic German said: ""I am good friends with all three. In fact the player I see the most is (Sania Mirza) because she is so good and No.1 in doubles so I see her in most tournaments on the final weekend. (Latest Tennis stories)""We have this good luck routine and every time we are having lunch and she is with her doubles partner and I am with the team, she is winning the doubles tournament.

""I am closest with her. And with all others I am good friends and we know each other for a very long time,"" he said.Becker recently ended his three-year-old successful association with current World No. 2 Novak Djokovic . The 29-year-old Serb won six Grand Slams under Becker's tutelage.Asked about the split, Becker said, ""Any player-coach relationship doesn't last forever. We had three successful years and won many tournaments. It was time to go separate ways.

He is not a machine, he is human. He has had his moments and sometimes when you have a long career you need to see the bigger picture. I'm sure he will come back next year and start winning again.""Asked while taking up coaching seriously, was he influenced by anybody, Becker said: ""I was running the German junior team for five years after my retirement in (1999) so I had my first hand coaching experience coaching the young German team some of whom made the world top 10.""Coaching is in a way difficult for a successful player because coaching is not about you but about the player you coach. And if you're a successful player your ego tends to come in between and it's a lot about yourself.""The number one rule for coaching is it is not about you but the player you're coaching. I think it takes a little bit of maturity, bit of wisdom and a bit of years on your shoulders to understand it. I think I am a better coach now than I was 10 years ago."""
"IT services major Infosys became the first India-registered company to be listed on NASDAQ on March 11, 1999. Infosys Technologies was also the first Indian company to be added to the NASDAQ-100 index, which lists 100 largest non-financial stocks in terms of market capitalisation. NASDAQ is the second-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalisation.","summarize: Infosys, the Bangalore-based software trailblazer, created history on March 11 by becoming the first Indian-registered company to list on Nasdaq, one of the two major stock exchanges in the US.Technically, however, Infosys is the second Indian company to list on Nasdaq, since the $30 million (Rs 126 crore) US-registered but wholly Chennai-domiciled Cognizant Technology Solutions listed in June 1998. Now the doors are open and we could expect to see at least 10 Indian information technology (IT), pharmaceutical and telecom companies follow Infosys' example over the next two years. By global standards, however, India's presence on Nasdaq will be modest. Some 80 Israeli companies and a good number of companies from Australia, Argentina and South Africa are also on Nasdaq.Nasdaq itself was launched in 1971. Although the most widely-tracked indicator of stock market health, the Dow, is based on its rival New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), close to 60 per cent of the total share volume and listed companies in the US is on Nasdaq. It is the popular perception that it is an exchange predominantly for IT companies, since its stars have been names like Microsoft, Intel, Oracle and Netscape.Actually, less than 20 per cent of the listed companies are in the IT industry. The bulk are in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, banking, telecom, electronics, oil, transportation and housing. By and large, Nasdaq is home to new, first-generation, technology-driven companies. Already around 20 IT companies founded by Indian-Americans with a total market capitalisation of around $16 billion - like i2 Technologies, Microchip Technologies and Mastech - are listed on it.It is to Infosys' credit that it has been diligently following American accounting principles for the past few years so as to make its debut on Nasdaq easy. The fact that it is a professionally-owned, one-industry company of relatively new vintage helped. Over 80 per cent of its revenues are generated in North America.But a large majority of established, family-owned Indian companies will have to rework their accounts if they wish to seek listing in the US. The American standards are ruthless. In 1993, Daimler-Benz listed on the NYSE. Its reported profit of $370 million under German rules got converted into a $1 billion loss by American standards.This is not so in India. Second, unlike India, the US requires all deferred taxes to be recorded. Third, unlike the US, India allows excess depreciation and provides a choice to the company on the method to be adopted for calculating the depreciation charge.Fourth, unlike the US, the Indian standard recognises the revaluation of fixed assets. Fifth, US accounting standards require gains or losses from foreign currency transactions to be included in determining net income. There are other differences as well - for example, the US does not allow proposed dividend to be accrued and requires current portion of long-term debt to be shown as current liability.The London-based International Accounting Standards Committee, a private-sector body of which the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India is a member, has been pursuing the cause of core, uniform norms to be adopted around the globe.

"Researchers have developed self-propelled microbots that remove disease-causing bacteria from water. The ""two-faced"" spherical bots have a magnesium side which reacts with water to produce hydrogen bubbles to propel them. The other face with gold traps bacteria which are then killed by the silver nanoparticles with an 80% efficiency. The bots can be easily removed from water using a magnet.","summarize: Berlin, Jun 30 (PTI) Scientists have developed magnetic microbots with silver nanoparticles that can zoom around contaminated water and clean up disease-causing bacteria. Drinking water contaminated with pathogenic bacteria can cause serious illnesses that, in areas with spotty medical services, are potentially life-threatening without proper treatment. Water can be disinfected with chlorine or other disinfectants, but there are some hardy bacteria and other microorganisms that are hard to remove. Treating water with a combination of disinfectants or increasing their concentrations can help. However, they remain in the water, and their byproducts can be harmful to human health. In recent years, researchers have been exploring the use of self-propelled micromotors to degrade and capture pollutants in water. Building on this work, researchers from Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Germany and Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) in Spain wanted to see if they could engineer tiny robots to remove waterborne bacteria. The team designed ""two-faced"" spherical particles to perform the task. One face is made with magnesium, which reacts with water to produce hydrogen bubbles to propel the microbots. The other face is made out of alternating iron and gold layers topped by silver nanoparticles. Bacteria stick to the gold and are killed by the silver nanoparticles. "
